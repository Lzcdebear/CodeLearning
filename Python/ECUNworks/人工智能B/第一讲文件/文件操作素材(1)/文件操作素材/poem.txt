Heartbeats fast　
Colors and promises　　
How to be brave　
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone　　
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow　　
One step closer　　 
I have died everyday waiting for you　　
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you　
For A Thousand Years　　
I love you for A Thousand more
