 You know I go insane every time you have to catch a flight
 Can I take you to the airport? Make out under the bathroom lights
 Put your lips on my lips, I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you
 Something I can't forget when I'm restless in bed, yeah, you got me obsessed

 Mmm
 You're okay

 Oh yeah (Uh)
 Can I call you on your birthday?
 Just to make sure that you're okay (You're okay)
 Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost? (Go ghost)
 And let you go your own way (Mmm, uh)
 Oh babe, oh babe
 You've been on my mind
 Just an old flame, old flame
 I left you behind
 But, oh, if it were any other day
 Maybe you'd want me to stay away
 I'm just wonderin' what you would say
 Or would it be a big mistake?
 Can I call you on your birthday?
 Just to make sure that you're okay
 Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
 And let you go your own way (Uh)
 Can I call you on your birthday?
 Just to make sure that you're okay
 Got the number to your old phone
 But is it working? (Uh, yeah)
 I ain't even callin' for no reconciliation
 I just want to tap in and see how you been
 I've waited for an adequate amount of time
 To give us both some space
 I think it's been good for us to stay up out of the way
 But it can't hurt to check up on an ex, not to flex
 But to put the hurt to rest, put maturity to the test
 So I'm callin' to say ""Are you okay?"" on your special day
 Can I call you on your birthday? (Birthday)
 Just to make sure that you're okay (You're okay)
 Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
 And let you go your own way (Uh)

10,1311091060,Overthinker,https://music.163.com/song?id=1311091060,"
A person who thinks all the time
Has nothing to think about except thoughts
So... he loses touch with reality
And lives in a world of illusions
By thoughts I mean specifically, Chatter in the skull
Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words
Of reckoning and calculating
I'm not saying that thinking is bad
Like everything else
It's useful in moderation
A good servant, but a bad master
And all so-called civilized peoples
Have increasingly become crazy and self destructive
Because through excessive thinking
They have lost touch with reality
That's to say...
We confuse signs
With the real world...

This is the beginning of meditation

Most of us would have
Rather money than tangible wealth
And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed
And to read about it the next day in the newspaper
Is oddly more fun for us than the original event
This is a disaster...
For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs
We are destroying nature
We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses
Time to wake up
What is reality?
Obviously... no one can say
Because it isn't words
It isn't material, that's just an idea
Reality is...

The point cannot be explained in words

I'm not trying to put you down
It's an expression of you as you are
One must live...
We need to survive to go on...
We must go on

I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
And a thousand times I've seen this road,
A thousand times
I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots

I like standing still for that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
And a thousand times I've seen this road,
A thousand times
I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground

It's all I see

We've been going to places nobody goes

And I feel like you're lifting me up
Now every time I close my eyes
I know that I'll wake up
With you in my blood
With you in my blood
And honestly
I can't believe
Where we are now
We've been growing together all of this time
And you to me are family
I love what I've found
I could never lose you even if I tried
Was it real or did I just make it up
And I don't know how it happened

14,1781925,Ode To A Nightingale,https://music.163.com/song?id=1781925," 作词 : John Keats
My  heart  aches,and  a  drowsy  numbness  pains
My  sense,as  though  of  hemlock  I  had  drunk,
Or  emptied  some  dull  opiate  to  the  drains
One  minute  past,and  Lethe-wards  had  sunk:
'Tis  not  through  envy  of  thy  happy  lot,
But  being  too  happy  in  thine  happiness --
That  thou,light  winged  Dryad  of  the  trees,
In  some  melodious  plot
Of  beechen  green,and  shadows  numberless,
Singest  of  summer  in  full-throated  ease.
O,for  a  draught  of  vintage!that  hath  been
Cooled  a  long  age  in  the  deep-delved  earth,
Tasting  of  Flora  and  the  country  green,
Dance,and  Provencal  song,and  sunburnt  mirth!
O  for  a  beaker  full  of  the  warm  South,
Full  of  the  true,the  blushful  Hippocrene,
With  beaded  bubbles  winking  at  the  brim,
And  purple-stained  mouth,
That  I  may  drink,and  leave  the  world  unseen,
And  with  thee  fade  away  into  the  forest  dim.
Fade  far  away,dissolve,and  quite  forget
What  thou  amongst  the  leaves  hast  never  known,
The  weariness,the  fever,and  the  fret
Here,where  men  sit  and  hear  each  other  groan;
Where  palsy  shakes  a  few,sad,last  grey  hairs.
Where  youth  grows  pale,and  spectre-thin,and  dies;
Where  but  to  think  is  to  be  full  of  sorrow
And  leaden-eyed  despairs;
Where  Beauty  cannot  keep  her  lustrous  eyes,
Or  new  Love  pine  at  them  beyond  to-morrow.
Away!away!for  I  will  fly  to  thee,
Not  charioted  by  Bacchus  and  his  pards,
But  on  the  viewless  wings  of  Poesy,
Though  the  dull  brain  perplexes  and  retards.
Already  with  thee!tender  is  the  night,
And  haply  the  Queen-Moon  is  on  her  throne,
Clustered  around  by  all  her  starry  Fays;
But  here  there  is  no  light,
Save  what  from  heaven  is  with  the  breezes  blown
Through  verdurous  glooms  and  winding  mossy  ways.
I  cannot  see  what  flowers  are  at  my  feet,
Nor  what  soft  incense  hangs  upon  the  boughs,
But,in  embalmed  darkness,guess  each  sweet
Wherewith  the  seasonable  month  endows
The  grass,the  thicket,and  the  fruit-tree  wild --
White  hawthorn,and  the  pastoral  eglantine;
Fast  fading  violets  covered  up  in  leaves;
And  mid-May's  eldest  child,
The  coming  musk-rose,full  of  dewy  wine,
The  murmurous  haunt  of  flies  on  summer  eves.
Darkling  I  listen;and  for  many  a  time
I  have  been  half  in  love  with  easeful  Death,
Called  him  soft  names  in  many  a  mused  rhyme,
To  take  into  the  air  my  quiet  breath;
Now  more  than  ever  seems  it  rich  to  die,
To  cease  upon  the  midnight  with  no  pain,
While  thou  art  pouring  forth  thy  soul  abroad
In  such  an  ecstasy!
Still  wouldst  thou  sing,and  I  have  ears  in  vain --
To  thy  high  requiem  become  a  sod.
Thou  wast  not  born  for  death,immortal  Bird!
No  hungry  generations  tread  thee  down;
The  voice  I  hear  this  passing  night  was  heard
In  ancient  days  by  emperor  and  clown:
Perhaps  the  self-same  song  that  found  a  path
Through  the  sad  heart  of  Ruth,when,sick  for  home,
She  stood  in  tears  amid  the  alien  corn;
The  same  that  oft-times  hath
Charmed  magic  casements,opening  on  the  foam
Of  perilous  seas,in  faery  lands  forlorn.
Forlorn!the  very  word  is  like  a  bell
To  toll  me  back  from  thee  to  my  sole  self!
Adieu!the  fancy  cannot  cheat  so  well
As  she  is  famed  to  do,deceiving  elf.
Adieu!adieu!thy  plaintive  anthem  fades
Past  the  near  meadows,over  the  still  stream,
Up  the  hill-side;and  now 'tis  buried  deep
In  the  next  valley-glades:
Was  it  a  vision,or  a  waking  dream?
Fled  is  that  music --Do  I  wake  or sleep?

with a glass of good malt whisky in his hand
at least that's what they say
he didn't leave much owing
when he finally paid the bill
maybe he should've settled a few old scores
but now i guess
he never will

i remember the time he told me
We were born under a golden star,
and maybe sometimes we couldn't find it,
and the journey seemed too far,
but it was just a matter of hanging in,
and we'd get there in the end.
Well,it seems you're going to find it.
my crazy beautiful friend

Mr.scott has left the building
the big old 12 strings is packed away
the gig is finally over and Scotty's on his way
but there's a song i still keep singing
and i'll never lose the tune
cause Scotty's out there somewhere
and he's howling at the moon
he's howling at the moon
i can hear him, he's howling at the moon
Scotty's out there somewhere
and he's howling at the moon

16,16964042,The Blue Notebooks,https://music.163.com/song?id=16964042,"Everyone carries a room about inside them
This fact can be proved by means of the sense of hearing
If someone walks fast and one pricks up one's ears and listens
Say at night when everything 'round about is quiet
One hears for instance, the rattling of a mirror
Not quite firmly fastened to the wall

17,410801177,Sonnet 20,https://music.163.com/song?id=410801177,"A woman’s face with Nature’s own hand painted
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted
With shifting change, as is false women’s fashion;
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
A man in hue, all “hues” in his controlling,
Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.
And for a woman wert thou first created;
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
But since she prick’d thee out for women’s pleasure,
Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.

18,410802161,Sonnet 10,https://music.163.com/song?id=410802161,"For shame,deny that thou bear'st love to any
Who for thyself art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt,thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lov'st is most evident
For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
That' gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O,change thy thought,that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged that gentle love?
Be as thy presence is ,gracious and kind
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove
   Make thee another self for love of me
   That beauty still may live in thine or thee

I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising ，
Haply I think on thee -- and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

20,1466215060,LA Who Am I To Love You,https://music.163.com/song?id=1466215060," 作词 : Lana Del Rey
 作曲 : Lana Del Rey/Jack Antonoff
I left my city for San Francisco
Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
L.A, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
L.A, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
L.A, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams you mean in nightmares

L.A, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
L.A, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't, and I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
L.A, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Saks, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?

L.A, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
L.A, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly I‘m resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security

L.A, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, could I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters, teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, L.A, can I come home now?

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter and promised myself that I would stay but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
**** the New York Post

L.A, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
But what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you

You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on, too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me

So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine

I've walked a thousand miles just to be here
And not a day too soon
Looking back at the life that we had
The things that we've been through
Remember this day, as I go my way
That leads me back to you
When the last note plays, the music fades
And I've done all I can do
Won't be afraid to walk alone
'Cause I'm on my way to you
···
Soon a new face will take up my place
The circle will renew
Another chapter, forever after
I know I'll see you soon
When the last note plays, the music fades
And I've done all I can do

 We talked around in circles and
 We talked around and then
 l loved you to the moon and back again

 You gave everything this golden glow
 Now turn off all the stars, cause this l know
 That it hurts like so
 To let somebody go
 To let somebody go
 To let somebody go
 To let somebody go
 To let somebody go

 All the storms we weathered
 Everything that we went through
 Now without you what on Earth am l to do

 When l called the mathematicians
 And l asked them to explain
 They say love is only equal to the pain

 And when everything was going wrong
 You could turn my sorrow into song
 Oh it hurts like so

 To let somebody go
 To let somebody go
 To let somebody go
 To let somebody go

Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

There comes a time when we heed a certain call

When the world must come together as one

There are people dying

Oh it's time to lend a hand to life

The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day

That someone somewhere will soon make a change

We are all a part of God's great big family

And the truth you know love is all we need

We are the world

We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making

We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares

And their lives will be stronger and free

As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world

We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making

We're saving our own lives

It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out

There seems no hope at all

But if you just believe there's no way we can fall

Let’s realize that a change can only come

When we stand together as one

We are the world

We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making

We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world

We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day

Christmas night, another fight
Tears we cried, a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford street
Trying to right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
And I'm up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I always loved you darling
And I always will
But when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas Lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on
Those Christmas Lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on
Oh
Ohh Christmas Lights
Light up the streets
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas Lights keep shining on

 作曲 : Paul Simon
Hello darkness my old friend.
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping.
Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
And the vision that was planted in my brain.
Still remains.
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone.
Narrow streets of cobble stone.
'Neath the halo of a street lamp.
I turned my collar to the cold & damp.
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light.
That split the night.
And touched the sound of silence.
And in the naked light I saw.
Ten thousand people maybe more.
People talking without speaking.
People hearing without listening.
People writing songs that voices never share.
And no one dare.
Disturb the sound of silence.
""Fool"" said I ""You do not know.""
""Silence like a cancer grows.""
""Hear my words that I might teach you.""
""Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent rain-drops fell.
And echoed in the wells of silence.
And the people bow and prayed.
To the neon God they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning.
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said ""The words of the prophets.
Are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"".
And whispered in the sounds of silence.

I wish that you could see the pain that I've seen
And all of the times I spent being not me
I hope you know that it's not always happy in my head
'Cause I don't know

But I know

I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day it's so hard
And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath 'til I can say
All of the words I wanna say from my heart
If you really wanted I could let you inside
It's been so long and I've got nothing left to hide
Would you believe me if I told you that I've got flaws
Now it's time to let the curtains unfold
And tell all the stories that I didn't want told
I let it out so I unburden my soul I won't stop

I see flowers through the window
I don't know why they remind me of you
'Cause your color is yellow
And that's the song that we played when we moved

Said goodbye back in May
Thought by now I'd be safe
Then it hits me, right off/out the blue
Every face that I see, a reminder to me
What I'd lost when I lost you

Baby, I've posted your number
We slept on the other side
But no matter what I do
I still get these butterflies
I've hidden all the pictures
I've tried stayin' out all night
But no matter what I do

I get drunk, I feel lonely
Trying to drown all the noise in my mind
Hmm, hmm
But alcohol doesn't hold me
The way you did, the way you would
When you were mine

And all the memories we made
They still hit me right out the blue

And over a village he halted his craft'
And it hung in the sky like a star'

just like a star...

He followed a light and came down to a shed'
Where a mother and a child were lying there on a bed'
A bright light of silver shone round his head'

And he had the face of an angel'

and they were afraid...

Then the stranger spoke'
he said 'Do not fear'

I come from a planet a long way from here'

And I bring a message for mankind to hear''
And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air...

And it went Ah...
Ah...
Ah......

Peace and goodwill to all men'

and love for the child...

Ah......
Ah...
Ah......
Ah...

This lovely music went trembling through the ground'
And many were wakened on hearing that sound'
And travellers on the road' the village they found'
By the light of that ship in the sky'

which shone all round...

And just before dawn at the paling of the sky'

The stranger returned and said 'Now I must fly'

When two thousand years of your time has gone by'
This song will begin once again'

to a baby's cry...'

Ah...

Peace and goodwill to all men

The shape ************fter mirrior image flash photo type
The ever lastin indiginal red blato type
he is born perfect and just like the great white shark
This guy has never had to evolve
Try to do as my name thats fatal
Tried to claim my fame but thats fatal
About to bring the pain thats fatal
Bite through your jugular vain thats fatal
Try to do as my name thats fatal
Tried to claim my fame but thats fatal
About to bring the pain thats fatal
Bite through your jugular vain thats fatal
Come on walk with me
Your not immortal i must have heard hundrends of you rodents
Make the same claim each one of them tasted the end of my sword
I stike back with avengence
The father of decendents
And i cant be deflected by your silver cross pendents
Blow the holy water you make the false images
Must wait for the signal ahhhh your life damenishes
Sing like the scorpian
Strike with the force of ten
My blood is going to revatilize the corpse of men
And the last thing they said the dead would walk again
The blind, deaf and dumb will talk again
Try to do as my name thats fatal
Tried to claim my fame but thats fatal
About to bring the pain thats fatal
Bite through your jugular vain thats fatal

Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Fearless on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath
Night night of matter
Black flowers blossom
Fearless on my breath
Black flowers blossom
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my...
Water is my eye
Most faithful mirror
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Of a confession
Fearless on my breath
Most faithful mirror
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath
You're stumbling in the dark

Fake Plastic Trees

Artist（Band）:Radiohead

Her Green plastic watering can
For her fake chinese rubber plant
In fake plastic earth.
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself.
It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out.

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns.
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins.
And it wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears him out.

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love.
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out.

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted,
All the time, all the time, ohhh... ohh...

Well now your here you are in your life
And now your finding out why
You've got to learn how to fight

Before you learn how to fly

So stick your fist up prove them wrong
Don't lose the words to the song

Coz its a long way down

I guess you know that by now

But if you hold on

Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up

Yeah I will reach up too

Well now your here in your life
Its such a long way down
Somehow you figure it out

So now you turn it around
But I know
But if you hold on

Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up

Yeah I will reach up too
Too...too.. too.

And one thing before you go
Just let everyone know

You refuse to regret it
Just like everyone said you would
Just like everyone knew you would
Just say that you can
Sleep at night
Just say that you get nervous
With the struggle you fight
You cant believe what your told
And you cant be alone and you cant let it go
lose and you cant control and you know

You are not just anyone
No your not just anyone

And if you hold on

Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up.. then I will reach up too
And if you hold on.. and I will hold on too

And he's got money
Shoots like an arrow -oh

The misery of a speeding heart
Its love u like, and everyone's at it
And words are cheap when the mind is elastic
He loves the violence
Keeps ticking over
So sleep together
Before today is sold forever

The way people just fall apart

The way you just don't stand a chance

She said there's ants in the carpet
Dirty little monsters
Eating all the morsels
Picking up the rubbish
Give her effervescence
She needs a little sparkle
Good morning tv
You're looking so healthy
And we all say
Don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes
Because we feel the same
And kiss with dry lips
When we say goodnight
End of a century... it's nothing special
*** on tv
Everybody's at it
And the mind gets dirty
As you get closer to thirty
He gives her a cuddle
They're glowing in a huddle
Good night tv
You're all made up
And you know that
And we all say
Don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes
Because we feel the same
And kiss with dry lips
When we say goodnight
End of a century... it's nothing special

Can you eat her yes you can

And we all say
Don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes
Because we feel the same
And kiss with dry lips

Coloratura
We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us
Is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out

Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself
And love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd

And up there in the heavens
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Helix
Oumuamua, Heliopause, and Neptune
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll get there

So for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto, Calliope
Betelgeuse, the neon moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon

So will you
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you

And up there in the heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
And all the satellites imbue
The purple, yellow, green, red, orange and the blue
Oh, it's a crazy world, it's true
Sing it out

And in this crazy world, I do
I just want
In this crazy world, it's true
I just want you

Poets prophesy up in the blue
Together, that's how we'll make it through

I saw a film
future visions of now
They changed the end
cause they always do somehow
Saw you tonight
for the first time in years
Crushed and thin
but your guardian angel's with you
judging by the way you walk
And I get a feeling
it wasn't that easy
Keeping a place like that
forever you fool me
you're a heavenly junkie
We live in the dreams you had
I get a feeling
It wasn't that easy
to be who you were

I saw a film
about the violence in men
I press rewind
Take it frame by frame again
Saw you tonight
life still danced in your eyes
You're creased and lined
but your guardian angel's with you
judging by the way you talk
And I get a feeling
it wasn't that easy
Keeping a place like that
forever you fool me
you're a heavenly junkie
We live in the dreams you had

Thin december air is like the dry ice smoke
You will come to your senses or inhale and choke
My IQ allows me to brush you aside
You are zeros and ones, you're wrong when I'm right
Now the tyrant is dead and his lady is free
I am going ahead with the reinvention of me
Now the king lies here dead, now the king lies here dead
It's not as wet as the rain or as cold as the snow
It drives him hard to the sane and the simple soul
I take a charge at my chance, you know how it is
Let go of my hand, you know how it is

I had two pillows at my head,
And all my toys beside me lay,
To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
All up and down among the sheets;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
And sees before him, dale and plain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.

151,24309246,A Dream By Christina Rossetti,https://music.163.com/song?id=24309246,"Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night
Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth.
I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled
Like overflowing Jordan in its youth:
It waxed and coloured sensibly to sight;
Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled
Young crocodiles, a gaunt blunt-featured crew,
Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew.
The rest if I should tell, I fear my friend
My closest friend would deem the facts untrue;
And therefore it were wisely left untold;
Yet if you will, why, hear it to the end.
Each crocodile was girt with massive gold
And polished stones that with their wearers grew:
But one there was who waxed beyond the rest,
Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown,
Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast.
All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale,
But special burnishment adorned his mail
And special terror weighed upon his frown;
His punier brethren quaked before his tail,
Broad as a rafter, potent as a flail.
So he grew lord and master of his kin:
But who shall tell the tale of all their woes?
An execrable appetite arose,
He battened on them, crunched, and sucked them in.
He knew no law, he feared no binding law,
But ground them with inexorable jaw:
The luscious fat distilled upon his chin,
Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes,
While still like hungry death he fed his maw;
Till every minor crocodile being dead
And buried too, himself gorged to the full,
He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw.
Oh marvel passing strange which next I saw:
In sleep he dwindled to the common size,
And all the empire faded from his coat.
Then from far off a wingèd vessel came,
Swift as a swallow, subtle as a flame:
I know not what it bore of freight or host,
But white it was as an avenging ghost.
It levelled strong Euphrates in its course;
Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote
It seemed to tame the waters without force
Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat:
Lo, as the purple shadow swept the sands,
The prudent crocodile rose on his feet
And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands.
What can it mean? you ask. I answer not
For meaning, but myself must echo,
And tell it as I saw it on the spot
"
152,24309254,Solitude By Ella Wheeler Wilcox,https://music.163.com/song?id=24309254,"Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
Weep, and you weep alone;
For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,
But has trouble enough of its own.
Sing, and the hills will answer;
Sigh, it is lost on the air;
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,
But shrink from voicing care.
Rejoice, and men will seek you;
Grieve, and they turn and go;
They want full measure of all your pleasure,
But they do not need your woe.
Be glad, and your friends are many;
Be sad, and you lose them all,
There are none to decline your nectared wine,
But alone you must drink life's gall.
Feast, and your halls are crowded;
Fast, and the world goes by.
Succeed and give, and it helps you live,
But no man can help you die.
There is room in the halls of pleasure
For a long and lordly train,
But one by one we must all file on
Through the narrow aisles of pain.

You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.
You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.
Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.
But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.
Love one another, but make not a bond of love:
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.
Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf
And dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.
For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.
And stand together yet not too near together:
For the pillars of the temple stand apart,
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.

Falls to the thought

With which we have been presented.
Blaming everything higher than ourselves,
Having never allowed anything to be higher than ourselves.
We feel the world through the lens of our lives.
We feel love
we see love.
We feel hurt
we see hurt.
We see a shadow of what our existence should have been,
We feel a shadow of what our existence could have been.

156,27869688,She Ran,https://music.163.com/song?id=27869688,"The night was cold and thin.
The air was scantily clad in such a way that she felt that
If she could but stop for a second, she could reach through it and grasp time.
Arrest it, stop it, bring back the years of hope,
Before the years of inevitably set in.
But she did not stop.
She ran.
Air is a precious commodity; one she had taken for granted until it was all she had.
Tonight she chased it; she felt as if her lungs could not get enough of it.
With each new step, a new shallow breath,
And a new resolve to continue filling her chest
With the last thing in this world that was free.
She knew that if she stopped, the night would end;
And she did not want the night to end.
The colors were too vivid.
First the reds…the piercing reds.
They swept out of the night sky in such an instant
That she did not have time to witness their origin.
But there they were.
Swirling, brilliant reds that swept her up like she scarcely remembered.
Indeed, did she even remember it?
Or was this the embodiment of a shadow she always hoped to one day remember.
The color floated around her as she ran, keeping up with her;
Perhaps even lagging back a little so that she could keep up with it.
She could not help it; she began to be entranced by its brilliance,
Though she dared not slow down.
She peered into it,
Trying to imprint upon her memory every detail of its stunning lifeform.
Then suddenly, did it change?
The reds were not quite as flowing as they once were.
They moved a little more awkwardly.
She knew she had seen that movement before, somewhere.
Then she remembered.
Yes! The reds were walking!
Alongside her they walked, still dancingly keeping up with her every running stride.
Their shapes became more and more human.
She recognized one of the colors.
He looked into her eyes with the love that said that it was already finished;
There was nothing she could do to ever spurn that love.
Then another color touched her shoulder.
She whirled her head around just in time to catch the shape
Of a life that spoke of a bond with her that nothing but tears could form.
In an instant, the motherly shape was gone,
But reformed next to the figure on her other side, walking arm in arm with it.
She almost stumbled.
Something had touched her heels.
She turned her head around long enough to see a child following behind her.
It was a little girl…a little girl without colors.
She skipped and sauntered, without a care in the world,
But all the time keeping up with her.
She wondered at the child; she wondered at childhood.
So happy, so light; all its cares are immediate.
There is no sense of that fact that time will one day have its way.
No one tells children the truth.
From somewhere behind the child, deep in the distance,
She thought she saw another red.
A different red.
But she couldn't be sure; she had to keep her head straight onward,
To immerse herself in the air, in the night.
Nor did she have time to worry about the new color,
Or the child, as the brilliant reds by her side had split into multiple colors,
Each walking at its own pace somewhere by her side.
They were dear to her…some moreso than others.
All looked at her with varying degrees of knowingness.
One in particular.
He looked at her with a seriousness, and a questioning.
His was by far the most tender touch, but not the most knowing.
She slowed slightly, gasping for breath as she did.
She turned to look at him, but her gaze was interrupted by the new color,
Now creeping along the horizon next to her.
It was a dark color, and threatened to swallow the red she now fought desperately to keep.
She reached out for him; but slowly he faded, and slowly the dark approached.
She had seen this before.
In an instant he was gone, and in his place were two other brilliant reds.
One for whom she cared, one with whom she was comfortable.
The dark color approached.
She tried to outrun it, but it was of no use.
It swallowed up the two colors just as it had swallowed the last.
She now saw that it was not a darkness, but a deepness.
A deep red that spoke of something she knew all too well.
It sent shudders through her life-stained body.
The shudders continued as she ran.
And continued.
Until she had unknowingly discovered that she was quite at home with the shudders.
She did not mind them.
In fact, the deep red had mixed with the brilliant red so much so that
Neither color was now better or worse for the mixing;
But they were more real.
Then, just as she was about to acquiesce to the new deep and brilliant red,
It suddenly birthed a figure.
And she hated.
She hated its curves, and its smoothness, and its beauty.
It tore from the rest of the colors, revealing its blackness.
And then, in horror, she watched as it reached back
Into the deep and brilliant red and pulled from it the loving figure.
He looked at her as she ran with the same,
Unquenchable love as before, as he faded off into the distance
With the beautiful black figure.
She ran harder; and at her heels she felt the child again.
She turned again to look, and now saw a young lady, walking warily behind her.
She knew that look; the colors had replaced the innocence.
She had never been sure which was more desirable;
But now she knew that neither could ever coexist peacefully with the other.
The deep, brilliant red circled around her and comforted her.
It did not split into its native colors, nor would it ever again.
And she was grateful.
Now there was another color.
It crept out from behind her.
She turned to look; were the colors coming from the child?
But it was no longer a child, or a young lady.
It was a young woman…a young woman with a war in her eyes,
Between childlike hope and the lamentable wisdom of the inevitable.
She recognized that look.
And she ran faster.
But she could not outrun the new color.
It surrounded her,
And here and there penetrated the deep and brilliant red with its yellow haze.
It was a tired color…so tired that it was almost transparent,
And blended in with the night in such a way that at times,
In her gasping for air, she would inevitably suck in its yellow weariness as well.
But she did not mind.
A little weariness might even be nice…
It made her feel as if her running was accomplishing something.
Accomplishment.
The reds spoke nothing of that.
She wondered at her life, and for the first time, looked upwards.
There were no colors to see through…just the night sky.
The vastness looked down upon her as if it knew her.
She slowed a little, letting her inconsequential state settle in over tired bones.
The yellow crept wearily into her upward gaze,
And she knew the child at her heels was now a woman.
She did not turn, but ran onwards,
knowing all too well the look in the pursuing woman's eyes.
There would be tears, resolve, the tiniest glints of echoes that were once laughter;
But most of all, the yellow weariness.
Her legs were tired, her lungs empty.
She inhaled without the benefit of air,
As the deep and brilliant red moved underneath her and helped her forward.
The yellow slowed her enough to where she could look around her a bit;
She discovered trees…big, green trees towering over her on either side.

And the little child softly padded around in front of her.
The bright eyes of the child were now furrowed under a wrinkled brow,
And the once beautiful cheekbones now protruded in
A manner unworthy of the years and wisdom that made them such.
At first she blushed with the hardness of the old woman's gaze,
But then stared back at herself with the same knowing inevitability.
The old woman took her hand in hers, and walked her down the path.
She tried to run to keep up, but could not;
The old woman dragged her softly and silently onward,
As the deep and brilliant red carried her,
The tired yellow enveloped her,
And the green trees lapped gently at their own dust which formed her body.
And she stopped running.

It had been a miserable night,
And they were excited to be able to go into the alley and play today.
They bounced the ball against the cracked bricks of the tall buildings,
And he even let her win a few times.
But this turn, he was going to win.
With all the bravado a big brother can muster,
He slammed the ball at the corner of the building where the curb met the bricks.
The ball ricocheted down the alley, towards an oncoming truck.
As it did, it dislodged some old newspaper crumblings,
And in the tired yellow light cascading onto the alley through the old buildings,
They saw it.
His sister screamed and went running back through the shabby aluminum door
Into their mother’s apartment.
But he couldn't move.
He stared at her.

They drove down the alley.
What a miserable day.
The night had been cold, and whenever the nights were cold,
He knew it would be a long day.
He watched as two children bounced a ball against the side of the grimy building.
The ball got away from them and in the tired yellow haze peering through the buildings,
He saw the ball dislodge some old papers;
And underneath it, he saw another one.
They stopped the truck and walked over to the body.
It was not her…it was never her; it was a shell.
He wondered who she was.
They picked her up, and he knew that beneath his gloves, there was coldness.
But her open eyes seemed peaceful; somehow that brought him comfort.
He looked into her eyes as the red of the bag enveloped her body, and she was gone.
It was then that he noticed the boy.
He hadn't moved, but was staring at them with large, questioning eyes.
He nodded at the boy as they carried her back to their truck,
And attempted a smile through his mask.
The boy was motionless.
""We're just taking her someplace where she can rest,"" was all he managed.
""I know what the green trucks mean,"" said the boy bravely.
""But you've never seen this before?""
The boy shook his head,
Fighting back the tears for which he had been taught he was too old.
The man stopped, and pulled his mask off over his head.
He looked straight into the boy's quivering eyes.
""It's very short. Don't waste it.""
He looked at the boy.
The boy looked back at him.
Not knowing what else to do, he slowly turned away,
Leaving the boy standing alone in the alley;
Older, whether he wanted to be or not.
They put her in with all the rest.

 作曲 : Dylan Thomas/Hans Zimmer
Do not go gentle into that good night
Old age should burn and rave at close of day
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Though wise men at their end know dark is right
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way
Do not go gentle into that good night
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
And you, my father, there on the sad height
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears I pray
Do not go gentle into that good night
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
"
158,27869683,The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock (Soundtrack),https://music.163.com/song?id=27869683,"Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
Oh, do not ask, ""What is it?""
Let us go and make our visit.
In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.
And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.
In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
And indeed there will be time
To wonder, ""Do I dare?"" and, ""Do I dare?""
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—
(They will say: ""How his hair is growing thin!"")
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--
(They will say: ""But how his arms and legs are thin!"")
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
For I have known them all already, known them all:
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
So how should I presume?
And I have known the eyes already, known them all—
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?
And I have known the arms already, known them all—
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
And should I then presume?
And how should I begin?
Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...
I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
To say: ""I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all""—
If one, settling a pillow by her head,
  Should say: ""That is not what I meant at all;
  That is not it, at all.""
And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—
And this, and so much more?—
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
""That is not it at all,
That is not what I meant, at all.""
No I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—
Almost, at times, the Fool.
I grow old ... I grow old ...
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.
Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.
I do not think that they will sing to me.
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with sea**** red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

159,1716709,Now Sleeps The Crimson Petal,https://music.163.com/song?id=1716709,"Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;
Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;
Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font.
The firefly wakens; waken thou with me.
Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,
And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.
Now lies the Earth all Dana? to the stars,
And all thy heart lies open unto me.
Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves
A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.
Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,
And slips into the bosom of the lake.
So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip
Into my bosom and be lost in me.

Work hard, the harder you work the faster you'll get what you wanna get

You people are gonna respect me, bet I'll make you respect me
This flow's deadly, it will resurrect Bruce Lee to be the famous Dead Lee
The only day that I don't put in work is the 30th of February
Do not **** with my money, it can be ten bags or 10p
I used to live off my overdraft but now my account is never empty

 Big smoke, clippin' the stick, stickin' the coke
 And they got guns, same size as Kevin Hart
 Please don't think it's a joke
 Back on tour with the gang and it's sold out
 Twenty-two dates, I ain't missin' a show
 Got the ladies hittin' my phone
 Got the mandem hittin' the woah (Greaze)

 Look in that mirror and see who you are
 All of this evil that's in my way, I pray to God, we're over arms
 Lil' kid trip, get gripped
 Hands all over these chips, watch this clip
 No, see I ain't no bitch when I'm bit
 I pull it with chicks, demand the most
 See, I'm not dwelling on that, focus on runnin' these lives, believe
 Who can it be?
 Why are my feelings so hellish, to the devil, indeed?

Prolly not
Real dark in the cemetery
Where the souls lie, oh my
What've I become, man I’m so high
Quit killing my buzz
Love drunk in the maze like, what have you done?
Where the hell are you taking me?
What are we running from?
Demons in the back of my closet, don’t talk to them
You wouldn’t want to be me, cos I’ve walked with them
And it wasn’t a nice walk; traumatised
Left me in a bad headspace
Lookin' to Heaven’s door I been saved, or have I?
Asked for forgiveness, can I or will I?
Negative at heart, am I?
Or shall I explain what the world done to me?
You wouldn’t understand what I been through Fully
And these dark thoughts ain’t nothin' new to me
And nobody lovin' me; Everybody through with me
Everybody lookin' at me diff'rent
And nobody’ll listen
I can see you starin' at me what do you envision?
No faith in me should I resort to religion?
But even I could never chase the life I’m livin'
I’m a druggie; I’m a fiend
Neva' been clean
Soul’s always been tainted
Homeless; What'chu know about livin' on the street?
Cold nights; You know right? Nothin' to eat
Figured that you wouldn't give me money anyways, even though I hear the coins rattlin' in your jeans
I ain’t even beggin' no more
**** it! Maybe I’ll just beg a little more
But don’t judge me
God above me, why do you have me livin' like a junkie?
****!
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Prolly not
Dark clouds ***** a **** a rainbow
Nobody talk until I say so
I just might sell my soul if it’s worth anything
But, we’ll see how the day goes

I just might sell my soul
Cause I dont feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Will anybody miss me?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not
I'mma sell my soul
Cause I dont feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not

Ooo mind’s on overload
Hit straight to the face might overdose
This ain’t the life I chose
What would you know
This ain’t the beginning I ain’t even come close
Bare robbing activity indulge
Is it very human I don’t think I have a pulse
Blacked out in the night *****
Devil on both shoulders and a ************' Angel to my right *****
Have you ever seen, a grown man cry?
Never me, I shared that need of nicotine
Heals me like medicine
Gotta be aware all times
Better be dog’s eye
Air lookin' for a diff'rent pedigree
I know you see it
Never get too comfy
Man I trust nobody
Feds always wanna roll on me
I ain’t done it I’m so sorry
You can take time, no hurry
Even though that I ain’t slept for days
My body’s achey but my mind’s awake
Said the flow is crazy, I should rhyme for change
Oh dear lady gimme the time of day
See when mind’s away
I can never own up to my mistakes
Perhaps it’ll take me to a higher state
No escape, I’m tryna find a way
I’m the one that you was tryna save
Please give up you don’t have time to waste
This is real, I’ve been waitin' my whole life to feel
Do you wanna see a dead body no chill

I just might sell my soul
Cause I dont feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Will anybody miss me?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not
I'mma sell my soul
Cause I dont feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?

Back in the days with my broski's
Yeah 'cause I miss them days
You know knock down ginger from door to door
Wake up, play squares in the cage
And that was a ting for our age,
That truly taught me a life lesson
Don't be a dog, be the king in the game
Spitting real facts get that stuck in your brain
And I remember, until November
Mandem writing bars and rhyming
Middle of the circle, spitting hard digits Sony Ericsson
Playing out Nutty Violinz
Those were the days I got used to, mmm hmm
And you know them ones when your boys got twos
And you gotta use Bluetooth
(Rah that one's a throwback)
And I remember, firework season
With the broski's never took no caution
And after the longest day in the ends,
We'd all grab a munch, a big portion
And you know my meal five piece with the chips
And the barbecue wings, lick our tings in the park
Have a laugh with the tings,

I remember the drip, it was Voi and I show love top
I came from the ground, now I'm grown,
I crept to the top
Look, I still got love for my bros
Cah I miss 'em a lot (Still got love for my bros)
And, hold tight the mandem locked in a steel cage box
Brozay wants to pop and bop, then
Back to the grind bro, watch how the T-line pop
We were kids in the 9 but my circle supplied 'dem crops
Look, the trapping looked peak
I bag and repeat, I slang it and pattern the streets
Wrap that two in the blue of the bujj
And crack to supply 'dem feens
Baby rock with the tug and I can provide your dream
Let me come to your crib for some lunch,
We can blow some trees
My R.O.D, she my sweetest one and my realest G
She be throwing it back and be brucking it out to the beat
Let me chat in your ear,
She's in love 'cah my voice too deep
She's in love 'cah my voice too deep

He got blacklisted, should've paid up
Pound coins in the piggy bank, gotta save up
Slept on the floor, never gave up
Now my ex-girl wanna kiss and make up
Man hate on a slide, got bait up
Word to Birmingham, I had to go straight up
Now they like wait up, hold on
SK level, that's so gone
They wanna know how everything sold out
Which website do your shoes get sold on?
Where the style at, this one can't go wrong
Put the clothes on, put my gold on
Thought that I was a victim, you were so wrong
Get sprayed up if you tryna roll on
Show's on, look at the girls in the line
Man, I got MILFs in love with the words that I rhyme
Even though I swear and I curse all the time
Saw me on the front cover of the magazine
And she said that it's perfectly fine
Now she got the bees and the birds on her mind
'Cause I can do uptown, I can do greazy
Yeah, I stay blurrin' the lines
I'm just mindin' my business,

Wanna flex like, ""No, you don't know me""
Can't pay the rent but you just bought a stony
You'll see, a wise man once told me
You gotta live within your means
You got a pocket full of cash
But you gotta have a lot more than what's in your jeans
No time to sleep, you better take a nap
Wake up, put in the work, and live the dream
It ain't overnight to get from the bottom to the top,
There's a lot of **** in between
Haters gonna intervene
Try draw you out
I realise there ain't nothin' to talk about
You gotta kill 'em with success,
Show them what focus is all about
Stop getting it twisted
You had a chance to shine,
Too bad that you missed it

Trudging slowly over wet sand
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
This is the coastal town
That they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come armageddon!
Come' armageddon! come!

Everyday is like sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Hide on the promenade
Etch a postcard :
\""how i dearly wish i was not here\""
In the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come' come' come - nuclear bomb

Everyday is like sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
（and on your face...）
（on your face ...）

（on your face ...）

Everyday is like sunday
\""win yourself a cheap tray\""
Share some greased tea with me

I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every vow you break

I wrote the song two hours before we met.
I didn't know your name or what you looked like yet.
Oh I could have stayed at home and gone to bed.
I could have gone to see a film instead.
You might have changed your mind and seen your friends.
Life could have been very different but then,
Something changed.
Do you believe that there's someone up above
Does he have a timetable directing acts of love?
Why did I write this song on that one day?
Why did you touch my hand and softly say.
Stop asking questions that don't matter anyway.
Just give us a kiss to celebrate here today.
Something changed.
When we woke up that morning we had no way of knowing,
that in a matter of hours we'd change the way we were going.
Where would I be now
Where would I be now if we'd never met?
Would I be singing this song to someone else instead?
I don't know but like you said
Something changed.

With hand on heart your right from the start,
You taught me to take my part.
No cross to bear, no reason to care, my life was all up in air,
Four to the floor, I was sure, never seeing clear,
I could have it all, whenever you are near.
The iron hand did not understand the plight of the common man.
Four to the floor I was sure, never seeing clear,
I could have it all whenever you are near.
Four to the floor I was sure, she will be my girl,
We'd rent a little world, have a little girl.

And forty movies with Will Ferrell

Yeahhh
Cos I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain

You made no preparation...
for my reputation once again

The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain

It was overflowing gently...
but it's all elementary my friends

Some might say...
they don't believe in heaven

Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell

Some might say...
You get what you've been given

If you don't get yours...
I won't get mine as well

Some might say we will find a brighter day

Some might say we will find a brighter day

Yeahhh
Cos I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain

You made no preparation...
for my reputation once again

The sink is full of fishes...
she's got dirty dishes on the brain

And my dog's been itching...
itching in the kitchen once again

Some might say

Some might say
You know some might say

Some might say
You know some might say

Some might say
You know some might say

Some might say
You know some might say

Some might say
You know some might say

Right, this one is for...massive

Is it my imagination?

Or have I finally found
Something worth living for

I was looking for some action
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime

To spend your days in the sunshineeee

You might as well do the white line

Cos when it comes on top

You gotta make it happen

You gotta make it happen

You gotta make it happen

You gotta make it happen

Is it worth the aggravation

To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for

It's a crazy situation

But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime

To spend your days in the sunshineeee

You might as well do the white line

Cos when it comes on top

You gotta make it happen

You gotta make it happen

You gotta make it happen

You gotta make it happen

You gotta you gotta you gotta make it
You gotta you gotta you gotta fake it
You gotta you gotta you gotta make it
You gotta you gotta you gotta fake it

Thank you very much

It was easier to have fun back when we had nothing

Nothing much to manage

Back when we were damaged

Sometimes the freedom we wanted feels so uncool

Just clean the pool

Send the kids to school

But oh I remember how you used to shine

Back then
You went down so easy like a glass of wine
My friend
When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again
But it turns out

You only get to do it once

I think it's true what they say that the dream is borrowed

You give it back tomorrow

Minus the sorrow

And the pain she just comes in to break up the daydream
And I felt his waving

To keep from feeling the same thing

But oh l remember how you used to shine

Back then
You went down so easy like a glass of wine

My friend

When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again
But it turns out
You only get to do it once

You only get to do it once

You only get to do it once

You only get to do it once. Ah once once once once once once once once
But oh I remember how you used to shine

Back then

You went down so easy like a glass of wine

My friend

When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again
But it turns out
You only get to do it once
Thank you

This one is called Shockwave

You sold me right up the river

You had to hold me back

You could’ve looked for the sunshine, yeah
But you had to paint the whole thing black

Now I'm back in the city

The lights are up on me

They tried to keep me locked away
But hallelujah I feel free

All your darkness has come back to you in time
Brace yourself world, it's about to blow your mind
It's coming round like a Shockwave, Hey
It's coming round like a Shockwave, Hey
You've played the game, won too many times
You're gonna burn until you behave, Hey
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
It's coming round like a Shockwave

You made your bed all pretty

You rip what you sow

Back stabbed all your friends
And yes it's all about who you know
So don't you dare look my way

To try to make you cry

I don't have to do a thing to you
Cos it's coming from the starry sky

All your darkness has come back to you in time
Brace yourself world, it's about to blow your mind
It's coming round like a Shockwave, Hey
It's coming round like a Shockwave, Hey
You've played the game, won too many times
You're gonna burn until you behave, Hey
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
It's coming round like a Shockwave HEY

You’re a snake
You’re a weasel
You’re a pebble in the sea
And the pain you feel is washing over me

It's coming round like a Shockwave, Hey
It's coming round like a Shockwave, Hey
You played the game, won too many times
You're gonna burn until you behave, Hey
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
It's coming round like a Shockwave

I will ..., yeah?

You were keeping secrets in ya

You be keeping paraphernalia
Oh I think you know

Anyone can walk up to you
Anyone can see right through your eyes all night

And I don't mean to be unkind

But I'll see what's in your mind

And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path

One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass

Wall of glass

One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

You believe in fascinations
And designer vaccinations
Love you get along

You were sold the one direction
I believe the resurrections on
And you were wrong

And I don't mean to be unkind

But I'll see what's in your mind

And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass

Wall of glass

One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

And I don't mean to be unkind

But I'll see what's in your mind
And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

Eii, Champagne Supernova

How many special people change?

How many lives are living strange?

Where were you while we were getting high?

Slowly walking down the hall

Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky

Someday you will find me

Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova in the sky

Wake up the dawn and ask her why?
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye

Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova
'Cos people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer

But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why?

Why? Why? Why? Why?

How many special people change?

We were getting high
We were getting high

We were getting high
No necessarily stone, but beautiful

Thank you, good night
Take care of yourselves, nice one

Right, the new one is Wonderwall.

Are you sure?

Yeahhh, see.

Here we go then.

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out

I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt

I don't believe that anybody

Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how
Let’s sing it

Because maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all you're my wonderwall

Biblical biblical biblical
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're gotta to do

I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that we have to walk are winding

And all the lights that light the way are blinding

There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how

Would like to say to you…

I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all you're my wonderwall

I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all you're my wonderwall

I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all you're my wonderwall

Thank you

Right, this’s gonna be the last one, I wanna dedicated to my mom there.
