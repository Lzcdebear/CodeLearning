 I just wanna get high with my lover
 Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
 Kiss, kiss
 Looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
 I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
 I just wanna get high with my lover
 Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
 Kiss, kiss
 Looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
 I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

 Forget the small talk
 The surface level ain't much that I care for
 Putting on my lipgloss
 I saw you stare from my peripheral
 Yeah, baby, it's been a hell of a day
 But I know a place we can escape
 Find out how it feels to let go of everything
 Be free
 When you're here with me

 I just wanna get high with my lover
 Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
 Kiss, kiss
 Looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
 I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
 I just wanna get high with my lover
 Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
 Kiss, kiss
 Looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
 I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

 There's nothing like peace of mind
 And you take the time to make sure that I'm okay
 I know I can put stress on your brain
 You still love me, put no one above me
 You always go out of your way
 To show me that I'm your priority
 Find out how it feels to let go of everything
 Be free
 When you're here with me

 I just wanna get high with my lover
 Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo (I just wanna get high with my lover)
 Kiss, kiss
 Looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
 I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
 I just wanna get high with my lover (Get high)
 Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo (High with my lover)
 Kiss, kiss
 Looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
 I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

 Get high with you
 Get high than higher with you
 Let's go to the moon
 And leave behind all that
 How does it feel, two of us getting higher than higher than that?
 There's nowhere we won't go together
 Go higher than higher
 No-no-nowhere we won't go

 Blast off, I'm gone
 Was it only just a dream
 Left him like an old fling
 Feels like silly puddy
 Troubled waters deep and muddy
 Never trust another mother's son
 Looking back now see what we've become
 Cause I can't really tell what you been on
 Sometimes it's like auto pilot
 And we can't see eye to eye

 Out of sight apologies come too late
 Tell me how to act but please it's not your place
 Feels like I've been with the wolves all my life
 Feels like you've been seeing stars, am I right?

 I don't need some-
 Body to hold
 When it gets cold
 And I shiver
 I don't need some-
 Body to blame
 Someone to frame
 Up in pictures

 Now I know how you found your way in
 Nothing you can do will ever harm me
 You can even see me at the weigh-ins
 You're not on my level, baby, sorry

 Out of sight apologies come too late

 You can keep up the charade, baby

 Just a scar somewhere down inside of me
 Something I can not repair
 Even though it will always be
 I pretend it isn't there (This is how it feel)
 I'm trapped in yesterday (This is how it will be)
 Where the pain is all I know (This is all I know)

 And I'll never break away (Can't break free)
 'Cause when I'm alone

 I'm lost in these memories
 Living behind my own illusion
 Lost all my dignity
 Living inside my own confusion

 But I'm tired
 I will always be afraid
 Of the damage I've received
 Broken promises they made
 And how blindly I believed (This is all I know)

 And I'll never break away (Can't break free)
 'Cause when I'm alone

 I'm lost in these memories
 Living behind my own illusion
 Lost all my dignity
 Living inside my own confusion

 I try to keep this pain inside
 But I will never be alright

 were you lying all the time
 was it just a game to you

In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh

For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand

I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralysed
I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
Because there'll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door

Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
but they tell me to please go **** myself
You know you just can't win

hey honey what you trying to say
as i stand here
don't you walk away
and the world comes tumbling down
hand in hand in a violent life
making love on the edge of a knife
and the world comes tumbling down
and it's hard
for me to say
and it's hard
for me to stay
i'm going down
to be by myself
i'm going back
for the good of my health
and there's one thing
i couldnt do
sacrifice myself to you
sacrifice
baby baby i just can't see
just what you mean to me
i take my aim and i fake my words
i'm just your long time curse
and if you walk away
i can't take it
but that's the way that you are
and that's the things that you say
but now you've gone too far
with all the things you say
get back to where you come from
i can't help it
under the april skies
under the april sun
sun grows cold
sky gets black
and you broke me up
and now you won't come back
shaking hand, life is dead
and a broken heart
and a screaming head

under the april sky
under the april sun
under the april sky

Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come—come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
Love
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

Запах женщины моей - я хочу остаться с ней,
С ней до конца моих дней.
Я хочу остаться только с ней. Она как в тропике мой снег.
Она лишь в топике на мне. Я хочу её сейчас, хочу её везде.
Она как будто самолёт, я её единственный пилот
Погрузись в водоворот. Лазурный берег нас зовёт.
Зовёт нас ща, зовет нас туда,
Зовёт нас туда, где песок и вода.
Зовет нас ща, зовет нас туда,
Зовет нас туда, где песок и вода.
Запах женщины моей - я хочу остаться с ней,
С ней до конца моих дней.
Запах женщины моей - я хочу остаться с ней,
С ней до конца моих дней.
Я тебя не обману дай мне руку свою,
Пройдём мы сквозь тьму.
Мы с тобой на ветру, пусть знают - это не трюк.
Пусть знают все - это самый настоящий тру!
Твой аромат меня дурманит, как жирный блант.
Лишь с тобой я готов коротать ночи до утра.
В этом корабле я твой капитан.
Ты единственная, кто не считала мой капитал.
(Ща) Звезды горят для тебя вечно.
(Ща) Для тебя миллионы огней.
(Ща) Это запах моей женщины.
(Ща) Запах женщины моей.
(Ща) Звезды горят для тебя вечно.
(Ща) Для тебя миллионы огней.
(Ща) Это запах моей женщины.
(Ща) Запах женщины моей.
Запах женщины моей
Я хочу остаться с ней, с ней
До конца моих дней.
Запах женщины моей
Я хочу остаться с ней, с ней
До конца моих дней.
Зовёт нас ща, зовет нас туда,
Зовёт нас туда, где песок и вода.
Зовет нас ща, зовет нас туда,
Зовет нас туда, где песок и вода.
Запах женщины моей - я хочу остаться с ней,
С ней до конца моих дней.
Запах женщины моей - я хочу остаться с ней,

Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason to feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction oh beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees
In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I took for granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance
Oh can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you

when I was young I'd listen to the radio
waiting for my favorite songs
when they played i'd sing along,
it make me smile.
those were such happy times and not so long ago
how I wondered where they'd gone.
but they're back again just like a long lost friend
all the songs i love so well.
every shalala every wo'wo
still shines.
every shing-a-ling-a-ling
that they're starting
to sing so fine
when they get to the part
where he's breaking her heart
it can really make me cry
just like before.
it's yesterday once more.
(shoobie do lang lang)
looking back on how it was in years gone by
and the good times that had
makes today seem rather sad,
so much has changed.
it was songs of love that i would sing to them
and i'd memorise each word.
those old melodies still sound so good to me
as they melt the years away
every shalala every wo'wo still shines
every shing-a-ling-a-ling
that they're startingto sing
so fine
all my best memorise come back clearly to me
some can even make me cry
just like before.
it's yesterday once more.
(shoobie do lang lang)
every shalala every wo'wo still shines.
every shing-a-ling-a-ling

43,5120906,Casablanca,https://music.163.com/song?id=5120906,"I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
Making love on a long hot summers night
I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca
Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe
Hiding in the shadows from the spies
Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
Making magic at the movies in my old chevrolet
Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
You know I've never really been there
So  I don't know
I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca

Every night in my dreams
I see you
I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us.
You have come to show you go on
Near far,
wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more,
you open the door,
And you're here in my heart.
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time.
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone,
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to.
In my life we'll always go on.
Near far,
wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more,
you open the door,
And you're here in my heart,
And my heart will go on and on
You're here,
You're here,
there's nothing I fear.
And I know that my heart will go on
we'll stay forever this way.
You are safe in my heart,
and my heart will go on and on

With the stars up in the sky
Are they shining over brenner
And upon the other side
You would be a sweet surrender
I must go the other way
And my train will carry me onward
Though my heart would surely stay
Wo my heart would surely stay

Now the clouds are flying by me
And the moon is on the rise
I have left stars behind me
They were diamonds in your skies

On a dark desert highway
cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colitas
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
and I was thinking to myself
this could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
There were voices down in corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
such a lovely place
such a lovely face
Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California
any time of year
                       you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-Twisted
She got the Mercedes-Benz
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys
that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
sweet summer sweat
some dance to remember some dance to forget
So I called up the captain
Please bring me my wine
He said We haven t had that spirit here
since nineteen sixty nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
such a lovely place
such a lovely face
They live it up at the Hotel California
what a nice surprise
bring your alibis
Mirros on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said we are all just prisoners here
of our own device
And in the master s chambers
they gathered for the feast
they stab it with their steely knives
but they just can t kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
to the place I was before
Relax said the Night Man
We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
but you can never leave

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
On the side of a hill in the deep forest green
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown
Without no seams nor needless work
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
Tell her to find me on acre of land
On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Washes the grave with silvery tears
Between the salt water and the sea strand
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
War bells blazing in scarlet battalion
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Generals order their soldiers to kill
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And to fight for a cause they`ve long ago forgotten
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Like oh
All the girls in the club like buy me a drink
All the boys in the club they're starting to stink
I'm just walking around in a baseball T
Don't want no empty love
Oh-oh

I been running over leaving in my head
Trippin' over all the stupid things you said
I keep stallin', and now I'm fallin'
It's like I'm constantly questioning you
So if you want me
Why are you tearing me apart
It's killing me slowly
Watching you hide behind your scars
Not here when I need you
I been trying to pull through
You play with my mind
Play with my mind
Play with my mind
But i'm just a fool for you
I play it cool for you
Every night, feeding me lies, I turn a blind eye too
I'm just a fool for you
I'm just a fool
For
You
I'm just a fool for you
I know you always tell me what I want to hear
It's like it's deafening the silence when you're near
All these blurred lines, but I still hold tight
Hoping you give me something that is real
So if you want me
Why are you tearing me apart
It's killing me slowly
Watching you hide behind your scars
Not here when I need you
I been trying to pull through

Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive
They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones, they'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh,  pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs the scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
When the world is calling out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness

And you played it To the beat (Rolling in the deep)

Waiting for my favorite songs

But they're back again Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I love so well
Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo still shine
Every shinga-linga-ling
That they're started to sing so fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
shoobie do lang lang
shoobie do lang lang
Looking back on how it was In years gone by
And the good time that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed
It was songs of love That I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away
Every sha-la-la-la every wo-wo
Still shine
Every shinga-linga-ling

Hello darkness my old friend.
I've come to talk with you again.
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
narrow streets of cobblestone
Neath the halo of a streetlamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared, and no one dared
To disturb the sound of silence
Fool, said I, you do not know
silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words and I might teach you
take my arms that I might reach you
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
and echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they'd made
And the sign flashed its warning in the words that it was forming
And the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls, and whispered in the sounds of silence

Love can touch us one time.
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone,
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to.
In my life we'll always go on.
Near far,
wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more,
you open the door,
And you're here in my heart,
And my heart will go on and on
You're here,
You're here,
there's nothing I fear.
And I know that my heart will go on
we'll stay forever this way.
You are safe in my heart,
and my heart will go on and on

79,5134039,Casablanca,https://music.163.com/song?id=5134039,"I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
Back row at the driven show in the flickering light
Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars
became champagne and caviar
Making love on a long hot summer's night
I thought you fell in love with me watching Casablanca
Holding hand neath the paddle fan in rick's candle lit cafe
Hiding in the shadows from the spies
Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
Making magic at the movies in my old Chevrolet
Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca  But kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
You know I've never really been there so I don't know
I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca

How's the world look from way up there?
I miss you
But I'm getting scared
Cause you used to be
Glued to me so perfectly
Filling all the in-betweens
Now there's nothing there
How am I supposed to be
Yours when I can't see your face
How am I supposed to not
Miss you with all of this space
Cause you say you'll meet
Me there someday
But how am I supposed to be
Close to you now

And then it's over
Yeah I think
I'm getting older
Cause I can't waste away the days with all
The things I wish I say but then we blink and it's over
So maybe I should put my heart out on the table
And ****it if it breaks
And maybe I've been hiding from what I'm afraid of
But I don't wanna wait
No I don't wanna ooh
I'm always running so I can't get close to you
But we don't got a lot of time to lose
And all I I want is to finally be honest
Yeah ooh
I'm always running but my feet lead me back to you
I'm always running but my feet lead me back to you
I'm always running but my feet lead me back to you
Go ahead and say it
What you want
I'm ready waitin
Cause we can't waste away the nights with all
The things we hold inside until we go ahead and say them

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few

Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities

I start from the basement, end up in the attic

I know the losin' don't come without shame

Inhibited, limited till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you
When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you
Seconds from my heart
A bullet from the dark
Helpless, I surrender
Shackled by your love
Holding me like this
With poison on your lips
Only when it's over
The silence hits so hard
'Cause it was almost love, it was almost love
It was almost love, it was almost love

We bleed ourselves in vain
How tragic is this game?
Turn around, I'm holding on to someone
But the love is gone
Carrying the load, with wings that feel like stone
Knowing that we nearly fell so far now
It's hard to tell
Yeah we came so close, it was almost love
It was almost love, it was almost love

When the walls came down

When my breath runs cold

When the walls were caving in
When I see you on the other side

Tears we cried, a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford street
Trying to right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
And I'm up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I always loved you darling
And I always will
But when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on
Those Christmas Lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me

Light up the streets
Light up the fireworks in me

I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well' It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away

To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me?
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart

Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

This is my winter song to you.
The storm is coming soon,
It rolls in from the sea
My voice; a beacon in the night.
My words will be your light,
To carry you to me.
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love
They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow,
Or so I have been told.
They say we're buried far,
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold.
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
This is my winter song.
December never felt so wrong,
Cause you're not where you belong;
Inside my arms.
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
I still believe in summer days.
The seasons always change
And life will find a way.
I'll be your harvester of light
And send it out tonight
So we can start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

So it's Christmas once more...

Rocking around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental
Feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this:
""I know exactly what I want this year""
Santa, can you hear me?
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing:
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?
I want my baby, baby (oh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe

And all I want is one thing

I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah
Bring me love I can call all mine, oh yeah yeah

Can't be alone under the mistletoe

In the empty space

Nothing to be heard
There's no your ""Hey, how was your day?""

Will you be in bed
Thinking about me
The love lasts forever
It's the word from you
Nothing lasts forever
I believe it's true
Something has to go on
In our history
It's an ironic story
Whenever you say I'm sorry
I'm ready to go in hurry
Whenever we stay in silence
Time is passing by
Don't be complicated
Love is incomplete
All I need is you beside me
All I need is you beside me
The love last forever

Nothing lasts forever
I believe it's true
Something has to go on

Forget the forever
Leaving for later
But later comes never
Shortened letter

Turns to
Hush, push, gosh, look us
Turned into pieces

And every time we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?

Need you by my side

I feel the static
and everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go
Want you in my life
Your arms are my castle
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad times

 You lit me up
 You made me feel as though
 I was enough
 We danced the night away
 We drank too much
 I held your hair back when
 You were throwing up

 Then you smiled over your shoulder
 For a minute I was stone-cold sober
 I pulled you closer to my chest
 And you asked me to stay over
 I said, I already told you
 I think that you should get some rest

 I knew I loved you then
 But you'd never know
 'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
 I knew I needed you
 But I never showed
 But I wanna stay with you
 Until we're grey and old
 Just say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go

 I'll wake you up with some
 Breakfast in bed
 I'll bring you coffee
 With a kiss on your head
 And I'll take the kids to school
 Wave them goodbye
 And I'll thank my lucky stars
 For that night

 When you looked over your shoulder
 For a minute I forget that I'm older
 I wanna dance with you right now, oh
 And you look as beautiful as ever
 And I swear that every day you'll get better
 You make me feel this way somehow

 I'm so in love with you
 And I hope you know
 Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
 We've come so far, my dear
 Look how we've grown
 And I wanna stay with you
 Until we're grey and old
 Just say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go

 I wanna live with you
 Even when we're ghosts
 'Cause you were always there for me
 When I needed you most

 So I wrote this song for you
 Now everybody knows
 That it's just you and me
 Until we're grey and old
 Just say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go

 Just say you won't let go
 Oh, just say you won't let go

Same place, but something’s different
Yeah I noticed some thing’s off
So fast, I almost missed it
But it’s too late, and now you’re gone

I spill another glass of wine
Kill the lights to pass the time
Cause you’re not here to ask me how I feel

I still hope you read my letters
That they bring you peace at night
Even at our darkest hour
I know that we’ll be alright

Makes no sense, I don’t believe it
Is it true that they can just take you away?
Walls were never made for freedom
And I’d break every single one to see your face

And I will hold the hourglass
Counting every grain of sand
Cause nothing feels the same until you’re home

I still hope you read my letters
That they bring you peace at night
Even at our darkest hour
I know that we’ll be alright

So many faces to remember
But yours is the only one I know
The one I believe in
The place I call home
I light a light for you tonight
Send out a prayer in my mind
Cause I know
We’ll be alright

Torn the world apart
Looking for some new vice that might heal it

But I’m terrified of being known
So I keep my secrets to myself
Why would I trust somebody else

I think i’m gonna hurt someone
If I keep running away, and I keep running away
I’m gonna hurt someone,
If I don’t change ; If I don’t change

Ive been spinning in circles & spiraling down
I should be honest with myself by now
Oh, why the hell do I worship approval and praise
I guess I’m scared of someone finding out ?
That I’m Inside Out

That I’m Inside Out

All the friends, I’ve ignored,
for the sake of this dream I’ve been chasing
Is it worth the reward?
If I lose everything I believe in

Oh I’ve been selfish to the core
I don’t know what Im fighting for
I’m sick of thinking about myself
I’ve left no room for someone else

Isn’t it beautiful
To feel it all
Let my heart break, it’s fine
If it’ll open my mind
I’d like to picture me
Simplistically
But what a convenient lie
Living in black and white

My heart bleeds red and I feel blue
And that took some time getting used to
But I know I’m really living
When there’s nothing more vivid than the truth

Draw myself like Frida Kahlo
See the beauty in my sorrow
I won’t paint a smile on my face
In my tears I find a state of grace
Every feeling’s like a color
Can’t love one without the others
I know when my sky is turning gray
I can paint it blue another day

Used to try
To close my eyes
To all of my darkest thoughts
Until they became my flaws

Yeah, I thought it was selfish to ask for saving
Guess I wasn’t seeing the mess I was making
’Til I stopped
And now I’ve stopped, and I see it

My heart bleeds red and I feel blue
And that took some time getting used to
But I know I’m really living

 Maybe I'm making things too hard
 Tell me that everything's alright
 Can you love me tonight?
 Can you love me tonight?
 I can take you all around the world
 My pleasure
 I ain't got my eyes on other girls
 You told me, ""Be a better man""
 I'm tired of playing pretend
 I didn't listen, now I'm wishing for a
 second chance, yeah
 Hit you up last night (Yeah)
 Something was different
 Didn't feel too right
 Right from the moment
 When you left me on read
 Started texting your friends
 Like, ""Look what he said again""
 He said
 The sun doesn't shine when you're not here
 Baby, am I making things clear?
 Tell me that everything's alright
 Can you love me tonight?
 Can you love me tonight?
 The mood isn't right when you're too far
 Maybe I'm making things too hard
 Tell me that everything's alright
 Can you love me tonight?
 Can you love me tonight?
 You say l never see your point of view
 But every time you say it, I'm confused
 Tried to communicate
 I guess our feelings changed
 And now I'm blocked by your friends too
 So I hit you up last night (Yeah)
 Something was different
 Didn't feel too right
 Right from the moment
 When you left me on read
 I started texting my friends
 Like, ""Look at what I just sent""
 I said
 The sun doesn't shine when you're not here
 Baby, am I making things clear?
 Tell me that everything's alright
 Can you love me tonight?
 Can you love me tonight?
 The mood isn't right when you're too far

You
You got it all
Set by default
With a glint
To dispense
I just know I’ve been blessed
Booze
They got a stock
Their ma and pa’s
And I sit
Through the stink
Of inebriation
Leave these drunken halls
Race you, count my win
Lunar disco ball
Dance like we downed all the shots
They’re just ornaments
Never took a sip
In our element
Both lost and found in you
Keep on going
Keep on going
Cause I~
Like to forget
Like to feel far
But no chemicals
Just organic hearts
Intoxicated
I’m lost in my head
And all I can think’s
You’re the best
I’m obsessed
Drunk in your irises
Everyday
Every way
No hint of ethanol in my bloodline
Legs are numb and I don’t feel right
Everyday
Every way
No hint of ethanol in my bloodline
Legs are numb and I don’t feel right
Two
Spirits and thoughts
Don’t have a lot
But they live
And they give
With whatever they got
Holding ornaments
Never took a sip
In our element
Both lost and found in you
Keep on going
Keep on going
‘Cause I
Like to forget
Like to feel far
But no chemicals
Just organic hearts
Intoxicated
I’m lost in my head
And all I can think’s
You’re the best
I’m obsessed
Drunk in your irises
Everyday
Every way
No hint of ethanol in my bloodline
Legs are numb and I don’t feel right
Everyday
Every way
No hint of ethanol in my bloodline
Legs are numb and I don’t feel right
Hold me, we’re all I need
You, me, everything
Hold me, we’re all I need
You, me, everything

Stand if we’re able
I’m going mad babe
Trying to save us
Cinnamon mornin’
You walk away again
I stumblin’ to your house
And it happens everytime
Baby stop
Don't you want to love me?
I know we're missing something
The stars have left your eyes
But I keep on telling you stop
Don't you want to hold me
Though things may not seem right, I know
Where there are roses up on Huntington street
Growing next to a magnolia tree
And there are people walking quietly
And there is you and I, oh I
I don't wanna feel the way that I do
Ain't nobody better for me
Babe my body's getting warmer
When it is you and I
Heat of the summer
Feeling of pure gold
I'm going under babe
Trying to keep a hold of you
Oh when I know that we might've been
Too proud to ever admit
But the sun is shinin’ on the bed we built
Oh but please stop
And lie here for a moment
Where time's forever frozen
I've been hoping
Where there are roses up on Huntington street
Growing next to a magnolia tree
And there are people walking quietly
And there is you and I, oh I
I don't wanna feel the way that I do
Ain't nobody better for me

Honestly
It's kinda been a couple crazy years for me
Letting go of things that were a part of me
It just didn't seem fair, wasn't going anywhere so

I did all the things, I couldn't get away
But thinking of love, it had me so afraid
I needed time alone, I needed time to crawl
I needed time to find my way, so

This time I'm gon' give it everything
And this time I know I'm gon' do it so damn better
This time I promise that I'm gon' give her
All that I can
'Cause I know she'll be worth a diamond ring
And I'll do what it takes to keep this thing together
After all this time you turned me into
A better man

I'm doing better now
All for my emotions to come back around
I feel like I can finally let my guard down
I'm finally going somewhere
Learning how to take things slow

I did all the things, I couldn't get away
And I'm thinking of love, but girl I ain't afraid
I had my time alone, I had my time to crawl
I had my time to find my way, so

This time I'm gon' give it everything (this time I'm gon' give her everything)
And this time I know I'm gon' do it so damn better
This time I promise that I'm gon' give her (whatever it is, I know I'm gon' give her)
All that I can
'Cause I know she'll be worth a diamond ring
And I'll do what it takes to keep this thing together (keep it together)

I don't know who she gon' be

If you ever find the time
I’d wanna wait
I won’t read between the lines
Don’t abbreviate
Say, what are you here for?
What do you live for?
What did you do to me that makes me wanna live more
How did you get here?
How do you see more?
Who do you think about when you’re bored?
Are you in love?
Or is it fools gold
Tell me are you in love, baby
I need to know now
We’re both so, so good together
Mistakeable?
Tell me are you in love, baby
That makes us both
It’s the only means to fly
Let’s aviate
Maybe if I wasn’t shy
I could regulate
Wait, how could I ask you?
I know I have to just find the words to say then
I could finally have you
Can’t let this past me
I’ve gotta catch you
Say if you’re falling down it’s my cue
Are you in love?
Or is it fools gold
Tell me are you in love, baby
I need to know now
We’re both so, so good together
Mistakeable?
Tell me are you in love, baby
That makes us both（both）
Are you in love（Are you in）
Are you in love（Are you in）
Took a minute just to say this
And I ain’t even patient
It ain’t even complicated
But i don't wanna break it
Just a little more than friendly
Now I’m talking crazy
Wanna say you’re my baby(you’re my baby,you’re my baby)
Up and down you come around and i forget to speak
Everytime you make a sound it makes me feel so weak
Try to play it cool
I don’t wanna lose you
Wanna say,wanna say to you
Are you in love?
Or is it fools gold
Tell me are you in love, baby
I need to know now
We’re both so, so good together
Mistakeable?
Tell me are you in love, baby
That makes us both

Now it's time for you to taste the bitter end
So I ask myself do I let you go
Or do I keep you in the frame of my mind
Now I'm growing wise to your sugarcoated lies
Nothing's sweet about my misery
I finally found what went wrong
I finally found the wrong in you
I finally found what went wrong
I finally found the wrong in you
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind

When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
how I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
all the songs I loved so well
Every shalalala every wo'wo
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're starting to sing
So fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
(shoobie do lang lang)
Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed
It was songs of love that I would sing to then
and I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away
Every shalalala every wo'wo still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're starting to sing
So fine
All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry

Passion is sweet
Love makes weak
You said you cherished freedom
so you refuse to let it go
Follow your fate
Love and hate
Never fail to seize the day
don't give yourself away .
Oh when the night falls
And you're all alone
In your deepest sleep
what Are you dreaming of
My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
I Said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
So the thought keeps spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If you are the rock I'll crush against
Trapped in a crowd
The music is loud
I said I love my freedom too
Now I'm not so sure I do
All eyes on you
wings so true
Better quit while you're ahead
Now I'm not so sure I am
Oh when the night falls
And you're all alone
In your deepest sleep
what are you dreaming of
My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
I said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
so the thought keep spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If you are the rock I'll crush against
My soul my heart
If you're near or if you're far
My life my love
You can have it all....oohyeahho ah.
Oh when the night falls
And you are all alone
In your deepest sleep
what are you dreaming of
My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
I said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
so the thought keep spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If you're the rock I'll crush against
ooh, if you're the rock I'll crush against.

Well I wonder could it be
When I was dreaming about you baby
You were dreaming of me
Call me crazy
Call me blind
To still be suffering is stupid after
all of this time
Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do
I do, you know I really really do
Well hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
I remember date and time
September twenty second
Sunday twenty five after nine
In the doorway with your case
No longer shouting at each other
There were tears on our faces
And we were letting go of something special
Something we'll never have again
I know, I guess I really really know
Well hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The day you went away
The day you went away
Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do
I do, you know I really really do
Well hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
Why do we never know
what we've got till it's gone
How could I carry on
The day you went away
Cause I've been missing you so much
I have to say
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The day you went away
The day you went away

 作曲 : Anson Long-Seabra/Jeremy Fedryk
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then Then straight on to the morning
Then I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
Just a lost boy in a small town
I'm the same kid but I'm grown now
Try to make it out but I don't know how
Wish that I was young what have I become
Now it's late night and I'm at home
So I make friend with my shadow
And I play him all my sad sad songs
And we don't talk but he sings alone like
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Fairytales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mm-mm mm
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then Then straight on to the morning
Then I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
Days feel like a blur now
Still feel eighteen but I'm burnt out
So I daydream of what I could be
If I turn back time to a storyline where my
Mom read me a tale where
A couple kids one girl and a sailor
Met a boy in green I thought it'd be me
But I guess that dream wasn't meant to be like
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Fairytales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mm-mm mm
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then Then straight on to the morning
The I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
And I don't care if I neverland
'Cause the distant sky's always better than
My life right now and the place I am
So for one last time I guess Peter Pan
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then Then straight on to the morning
Then I know that I'll be fine
'Cause I know Peter Pan was right

Sorry to your next ex
For the bar that I set
I might've been too perfect
Put with your bullshit
For a little bit too long
Now you're having trouble moving on

So go feed them whatever lies
To get yourself through, maybe look online
Somebody will love you
But will they love like I used to?

I don't mean to be in your mind
I can't seem to get out, must be all of the times
I made you happier than you are now
Bet they won't get you high enough to get over me

They may be tall
But don't stack up to mе

Sorry to your next ex
For the bar that I sеt
I might've been too perfect
Put up with your bullshit
For a little bit too long
Now you're having trouble moving on
So tell them I'm an asshole
Say that I was needy
I never made you laugh once
Whatever makes it easy
To find another perfect pawn
That's down to make up for your flaws

You're so see-through posting your fun
I could really care less 'cause you're still on the hunt
For someone better than the best
I didn't mean to make a mess out of everything

Guess I'm too good
Not to make a mess of things

So sorry to your next ex
For the bar that I set
I even went into debt
For a honeymoon trip
And wasn't even twenty-one
Now I'm the one that's moving on
So tell them I'm an asshole
Say that I was greedy
I never got you off once
Whatever makes you happy
I'm sure you'll find a perfect pawn
And they'll be down to make up for your flaws

Good luck finding someone who
Can love you like I used to
Can't hurt me now that I'm gone, I'm gone

I hope you find a guy to fill the void
'Cause you and me know you'll never last without a toy

So hello to the next ex
Hope you like a train wreck
Maybe she'll be different
I wouldn't quite expect it
But for your sake I hope I'm wrong
'Cause maybe then I was the cause

 Lay me down
 Keep me distracted when you're not around
 I find myself so lonely, help me out
 We both know we got things to talk about, talk about

 Is something on your mind?
 Do you need me to tell you that it's alright?
 Have we been sleeping on different sides?
 If you're falling behind
 I'm sorry but I-

 Turn around
 Our loves not missing, it gets lost and found

 On certain days, we’re afraid
 Of saying we don't feel the same, feel the same
 And maybe we should take today
 Just to say, the thoughts that keeps us wide awake, wide awake

 I'll never change

 I'll never change just 'cause you want me to

Is there something
After there is nothing to say?
We're just moving in circles
But we're losing our shape

Oh, where did all the good things go?
Oh, falling out of love too slow

It's a beautiful morning
Don't throw it away
If I gave you the sunset, you'd wish for the rain
Do you even notice
What I'm trying to say?
If I gave you the ocean, you'd complain'bout the waves

Guess there's nothing
Feels like I'm not doing this right

We don't need a plan to live in this moment

Sometimes you gotta take a chance while it's there

I don't wanna spend my whole life hoping

So tell me baby are we going somewhere

We don't need to hold back not for a minute

I'm painting a picture and I want you in it
Anything you dream of I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere
Or are we waving at cars
Just
Watching them pass is
That who we are
Just
Stuck at the start and
Watching them go back
Waiting for a ride
Wondering if we're gonna be alright
Waving at cars
Wishing they were ours
Why are we waving at cars
Just
Watching them pass is
That all we are

Just waving at cars

We could spend the night going round in circles

Talking about all the fears we share
Or we could just go get those windows open

And you and I could finally go somewhere

We don't need to hold back not for a minute

I'm painting a picture and I want you in it

Anything you dream of I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere
Or are we waving at cars

Is that all we are

I'm tired of being stuck at the start

Even if it tears us apart

I'd rather go than stay where we are

 Okay, it's time that I drop the act
 I got it bad for you, baby, is that so bad?
 I don't know how to tell you
 That one night in college
 We almost went home with
 Each other, I kind of wish we had
 But we've been dancing around it

 We could tell each other that it's dumb to try
 Or you've been busy with your job and got no time
 Or I think love is stupid, and I'm not looking for something exclusive
 Oh, we laugh at everybody in relationships
 Your dad would probably think that I'm a piece of shit
 But I think we should do this, no excuses
 'Cause we know excuses only get in the way
 Of what I feel for you
 Of what I feel for you
 Of what I feel for you
 Oh

 I know we said we should be just friends
 Promised we would get married
 If we turned 40 and we're still single then
 Yeah, I know that it's scary
 To talk about commitment, we're classic millennials
 But I think I love you, think you know I think you're beautiful

 Oh oh oh oh

 We could tell each other that it's dumb to try
 Or you've been busy with your job and got no time

 'Cause we know excuses only get in the way

 Of what I feel for you
 Of what I feel for you
 Oh oh oh

 Every time you're in my presence
 I send a flirty ""You up?"" message, oh
 Why do we keep second guessing
 I think I love you, there I said it

 We could tell each other that it's dumb to try

Dreams are getting bigger but the house feels small
You're in every picture hanging on my wall

Ride my bicycle in fancy pants
This is the best day ever

Last night, l cried till my tears ran out
Right now, I just wanna be happy
l'm scared I lost what it's all about
When did my heart get so heavy?

But I keep going and I don't look back

Only smiling like a child

 All this time we spent among the stars
 Did you ever wonder, wonder who we are?

 Heads up, Into the night we're heading
 Top-down, Chasing the lights they're blinding
 Everything, everyone and we don't hear a sound

 High speed, up in the sky we' 're shooting
 Like stars, diamonds so bright before they
 Finally, come down we watch 'em from afar

 But the look in your eyes is telling me that I'm а fool
 We're building a house with bricks of gold but empty rooms

 We used to live forever
 Like lovers on the run
 We lost our way to heaven
 Now come on come on come on
 If we can't run together
 Why did we from the start?
 If it's beauty over pleasure
 Than you know you know we are
 A home without a heart

 It's late, no time for talk
 Oh we know at this rate we'll run out of love
 But we keep coming back, coming back, we can't get enough

 You say Why should we care?
 We're only twenty-two no time for despair
 So let's go everywhere, anywhere we gotta speed it up""

you’re making up the truth
Why can’t
I go
before I loose my cool
I love you even if it’s difficult
Don’t worry just because I need to leave
Don’t mean I’m sick of us, of you and me
I’m just not good at showing sympathy
Give me a break
I’m not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I’m not angry anymore
Just a little upset now
Cause I Wanna be better than I was before
But I can’t do it if we don’t mature
Not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I love the way you look me in the eyes
When you choke up but can’t apologize
Cause you are too afraid to hurt your pride
I guess you were just so misunderstood
You know I’m never truly gone for good
If I could look inside your brain you know I would, you know I would, you know

And all the dust is following me
And the lights go out

 Tryna balance all these up and downs but I keep poppin' lows (Lows)
 What it is? What it is? That's just how it goes
 Pure session, I just kept progressin', and finally found the flow (Flow)
 If the answers down there with the devil, I may never know (Let's go)
 My dawg just got freed out the precinct (Free)
 Hid it in my bag, let's hit Turks for the weekend (Let's go)
 Why did I pop two out that whole pack? Dawg, I'm tweakin' (Geeked)
 Baby girl, come suck, keep me up, ain't no sleepin', ooh
 She gon' let me beat that body up like we beefin' (Beefin')
 Better yet she vegan (Vegan), better yet she tweakin' (Tweakin')
 Yeah, 6 A.M., I hit my alarm clock (Yeah)
 You see the vision, this shit non-stop, gotta keep my palms hot (Hot)
 Got long roads in my backyard, *****, I'm a lonestar
 The droptop came with the top, I cut the door apart
 My brodie keep a stainless to steal, ain't no Chrome Heart (Grr)
 I cut some off, I had to better myself
 Against the odds, I'd bet on myself
 I was at Frank Gibbins before Thanksgiving, thanks to my health
 Too many flaws, tryna generate wealth
 Man, that's how you go broke and lose bros and lose hope in this shit
 I was thinkin' that we both could be rich, I guess it's one-sided
 Crazy how they love to talk shit and got no Trident
 I'm loyal, *****, I got Ye over Biden
 I let the shit go off the top, yeah, no typin'
 How I go from overlooked to these niggas is overbitin'?
 How I'm always in they ear? I'm enticin'
 And you ain't gotta take it from me, I'm advisin', for real

 Have you ever been lost?
 Have you ever been lost?
 Forever

 Lost on islands, driven in boat cars
 Just bring your girl, feel like she both ours
 Young black nigga work at the Auchans
 So how we here trapped on the ocean?
 'Bout to go up a level of disrespectful
 I'm just one chain away from goin' heavy metal
 I'm just one angel away from blockin' out the devil
 Just one mountain away from meetin' all my rebels
 Too much power, too many hours all in a day
 I sent her flowers, ain't talkin roses, I'm talkin' maoda
 Ask if she ""Ha-ha-ha"" I really doubt it (Ha-ha-ha)
 Took her through the Hills at noon, she felt the... (And how wonderful, how wonderful)
 Baby girl think she in Honolu' (Wonderful)
 Don't you know you in the I-5 loop? (How wonderful)
 How many chickens fit in the coupe? (How wonderful, wonderful)
 Wonderful, she don't wanna leave
 She jump up, bounce back like trampoline (How you are, forever)

 Ayo, whip the ******* 'til the pot bust ('Til the pot bust, ah)
 You was on the porch, I was locked up (I was locked up, ah)
 Two-tone Maybach truck with the Maxwells (Skrrt, Maxwells)
 Think a nigga shot somethin' (Ah)
 Put it to your face, watch a mother****er blow (Boo-boo-boo-boo-boom)
 Daytona, different color face on the road (Ah)
 Ten on his head, he be dead by the mornin' (By the mornin')
 I can get dirty for the stove (Ah)
 Dior trench shit hang to the floor (Ah)
 Dior goggles, I ain't playin' with you hoes (Uh-uh)
 Out in South Beach with the poles in the Rolls (Skrrt, boo-boo-boo-boo-boom)
 Good to see ya dudes, alligators on the toes (Ah)
 Fashion week I'ma strut too, ******* (Ah)
 Hundred-round drum, make a nigga go get it (Make a nigga go get it, grrt)
 Tribe go to sell a fifth, bucket while we drillin' (Boo-boo-boo-boo-boom)
 Had to sneak my new Glock up in Lenox (Ah)
 Free Slide Grinny got pay digits
 Socks Burberry, **** sucks on the visit (Ah, brrrt)

 First one to pop, first to earn the stripes
 Three strikes in, twenty-five to life (Uh-uh)
 Hyping up the building, hyping up the sights
 Whips got the wings of angel kit
 I been wanting this shit my whole life, I didn't pray for it
 She want me to come into his house but I can't kick it
 She want the whole dub-dub E, but I ain't convinced
 Never met her she, but she met Sheck, she don't need a prince
 Took her off the O into the D, she ain't take offense
 Way we got it bouncin' off the boards we making prints
 Wait until I step into the floor and then they commence

You know what the Midwest is?
Young and restless
Where restless (N!ggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (N!ggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (N!ggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
*Gasps*
Try to catch it
*Gasps*
It's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of sh!t like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of sh!t? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of c0ke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move

So long
So long

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
Jesus walks for them
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
Jesus walks for them
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, s3x, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
Jesus walk with me
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

When  it  comes  to  being  true,at  least  true  to  me
One  thing  I  found,one  thing  I  found
Oh  no  you'll  never  let  me  down,
Get  up  I  get（down）
Get  up  I  get（down）
Get  up  I  get（down）
Get  up  I  get（down）
Get  up  I  get（down）
Get  up  I  get（down）
Yo,yo  first  I  snatched  the  street  then  I  snatched  the  charts,
First  had  they  ear  now  I  hav  they're  heart,
Rappers  came  and  went,
I've  been  hear  from  the  start,
Seen  them  put  it  together
Watch  them  take  it  apart,
See  the  Rovers  roll  up  wit  ribbons
I've  seen  them  re-poed,re-sold  and  re-driven
So  when  I  reload,he  holds #1position
When  u  hot  I'm  hot
And  when  your  feet  cold,mines  is  sizzelin
It's  plain  to  see
Never Let Me Down - Kanye West, J. Ivy, JAY-Z (from the album The College Dropout) - Bitches can't **** with m
Never Let Me Down - Kanye West, J. Ivy, JAY-Z (from the album The College Dropout) - 'Cause I'ma be that bitch fo lif
This  is  not  an  image
This  is  God  given
This  is  hard  liven
Mixed  wit  crystal  sipping
It's  the  most  consistent
Hov
Give  you  the  most  hits  you  can  fit  inside  a  whole  disc  and
Never Let Me Down - Kanye West, J. Ivy, JAY-Z (from the album The College Dropout) - Bitch, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visiti
It's  Hov  tradition,Jeff  Gordan  of  rap
I'm  back  to  claim  pole  position,holla  at  ya  boy
Chorus]
Kanye  West:]
I  get  down  for  my  grandfather  who  took  my  momma
Made  her  sit  that  seat  where  white  folks  ain't  wanna  us  to  eat
At  the  tender  age  of 6she  was  arrested  for  the  sit  in
With  that  in  my  blood  I  was  born  to  be  different
Never Let Me Down - Kanye West, J. Ivy, JAY-Z (from the album The College Dropout) - Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leaders, shi
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealer shit
That's  why  I  hear  new  music
And  I  just  don't  be  feeling  it
Racism  still  alive  they  just  be  concealing  it
But  I  know  they  don't  want  me  in  the  damn  club
They  even  made  me  show  I.D  to  get  inside  of  Sam's  club
I  did  dirt  and  went  to  church  to  get  my  hands  scrubbed
Swear  I've  been  baptised  at  least 3or 4times
Never Let Me Down - Kanye West, J. Ivy, JAY-Z (from the album The College Dropout) - But in the land where niggas prais
Yukons  and  getting  paid
It  gon'take  a  lot  more  than  coupons  to  get  us  saved
Like  it  take  a  lot  more  than  do-rags  to  get  your  waves
Noting  sadder  than  that  day  my  girl  father  past  away
So  I  promised  to  Mr  Rany  I'm  gonna  marry  your  daughter
And  u  know  I  gotta  thank  u  for  they  way  that  she  was  brought  up
And  I  know  that  u  were  smiling  when  u  see  that  car  I  bought  her
And  u  sent  tears  from  heaven  when  u  seen  my  car  get  balled  up
But  I  can't  complaint  what  the  accident  did  to  my  Left  Eye
Cuz  look  what  a  accident  did  to  Left  Eye
First  Aaliyah  and  now  romeo  must  die
I  know  a  got  angels  watching  me  from  the  other  side
Chorus]
We  are  all  here  for  a  reason  on  a  particular  path
You  don't  need  a  curriculum  to  know  that  you  are  part  of  the  math
Cats  think  I'm  delirious,but  I'm  so  damn  serious
That's  why  I  expose  my  soul  to  the  globe,the  world
I'm  trying  to  make  it  better  for  these  little  boys  and  girls
I'm  not  just  another  individual,my  spirit  is  a  part  of  this
That's  why  I  get  spiritual,but  I  get  my  hymns  from  Him
So  it's  not  me,it's  He  that's  lyrical
I'm  not  a  miracle,I'm  a  heaven-sent  instrument
My  rhythmatic  regimen  navigates  melodic  notes  for  your  soul  and  your  mental
That's  why  I'm  instrumental
Vibrations  is  what  I'm  into
Yeah,I  need  my  loot  by  rent  day
But  that  is  not  what  gives  me  the  heart  of  Kunte  Kinte
I'm  tryina  give  us ""us  free""like  Cinque
I  can't  stop,that's  why  I'm  hot
Determination,dedication,motivation
I'm  talking  to  you,my  many  inspirations
When  I  say  I  can't,let  you  or  self  down
If  I  were  of  the  highest  cliff,on  the  highest  riff
And  you  slipped  off  the  side  and  clinched  on  to  your  life  in  my  grip
I  would  never,ever  let  you  down
And  when  these  words  are  found
Let  it  been  known  that  God's  penman*******p  has  been  signed  with  a  language  called  love
That's  why  my  breath  is  felt  by  the  deaf
And  why  my  words  are  heard  and  confined  to  the  ears  of  the  blind
I,too,dream  in  color  and  in  rhyme
So  I  guess  I'm  one  of  a  kind  in  a  full  house
Cuz  whenever  I  open  my  heart,my  soul,or  my  mouth
A  touch  of  God  reigns  out
Chorus]
Jay-Z （Kanye  West）]
Who  else  you  know  been  hot  this  long,
（Oh  Ya,you  know  we  ain't  finished）
Started  from  nothing  but  he  got  this  strong,
（The  ROC  is  in  the  building）
Built  the  ROC  from  a  pebble,pedalled  rock  before  I  met  you,
Pedalled  bikes,got  my  nephews  pedal  bikes  because  they  special,
Let  you  tell  that  man  I'm  falling,
Well  somebody  must've  caught  him,
Cause  every  fourth  quarter,I  like  to  Mike  Jordan 'em,
Number  one  albums,what  I  got  like  four  of  dem,
More  of  dem  on  the  way,
The  Eight  Wonder  on  the  way,
Clear  the  way,I'm  here  to  stay,
Y'all  can  save  the  chitter  chat,this  and  that,this  and  Jay,

Six  Hail  Maries,please  Father  forgive  us,
Never Let Me Down - Kanye West, J. Ivy, JAY-Z (from the album The College Dropout) - Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The  way  y'all  all  follow  Jigga,
Hov's  a  living  legend  and  I  tell  you  why,
Everybody  wanna  be  hov  and  hov  still alive

 In the nick of time, that's when you appeared
 Girl, I was lost till you found me here
 My hair was long but my head was low
 And now I'm here 'cause you made it so

 Girl, I don't deserve you
 You're the one I turn to
 Never meant to hurt you

 You're my saving grace, grace, grace, grace
 Grace, grace, grace
 You're my saving grace, grace, grace, grace

 In Montego Bay in a storm of snow
 I was trying not to let you go
 Percocet with the Lexapro
 And if you talk, won't you let me know?
 As love expired, tired of the back-and-forth

 Girl, I don't deserve you
 You're the one I turn to
 Never meant to hurt you

 You're my saving grace, grace, grace, grace
 Grace, grace, grace
 You're my saving grace, grace, grace, grace

Prelude foreshadowing: Swing
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness but Idon't know why
Without youit's hard to survive
Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
need you by my side
Cause everytime we touch I feel the static
And everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat slow
Ican't let you go
Want you in my life
Cause everytime we touch I feel the static
And everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so
I want this to last
need you by my side
Vertices: rocking
Your arms are my castle your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad timeswe've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall
Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
need you by my side
Cause everytime we touch I feel the static
And everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat slow
Ican't let you go
Want you in my life
Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
need you by my side

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi, I was all alone

With the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour
You slow down time
In your golden hour

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour
You slow down time
In your golden hour

If you keep wondering if somebody understands
Darling, I don't understand you
If you stay awake at night waiting for somebody right
Baby, oh, your karma is due
Like, I would never hate you
But only if you want to
So much time like who knew? (Like who knew?)
Music we got into
Songs we fell in love to
Boy this feels so wrong too (Ah, ah, ah)
If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up
If we ever broke up, I'd call your dad
And tell him all the sh!ttiest of things you've said
If wе ever broke up
Boy, don't gеt emotional
'Cause it's not personal
It's just the way, just the way it goes
If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up
You're living in Wonderland
If you think I'll understand
All the sh!t you put me through
If girls in white dresses and big winter wedding
Is something you want to be true (Yeah)
Then pack up your drama, this selfish dilemma
Is something this sh!t can't undo
Like, I would never hate you
But only if you want to
So much time like, who knew? Woah
If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up (Ha, ah, ah)
If we ever broke up, I'd call your dad
And tell him all the sh!ttiest of things you've said

The streets will glow forever bright

By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday

 Forget the small talk
 The surface level ain't much that I care for

 Yeah, baby, it's been a hell of a day
 But I know a place we can escape
 Find out how it feels to let go of everything

 You still love me, put no one above me
 You always go out of your way

 Find out how it feels to let go of everything

 Get high with you
 Get high than higher with you
 Let's go to the moon
 And leave behind all that
 How does it feel, two of us getting higher than higher than that?
 There's nowhere we won't go together
 Go higher than higher
 No-no-nowhere we won't go

I been running over leaving in my head
Trippin' over all the stupid things you said
I keep stallin', and now I'm fallin'
It's like I'm constantly questioning you
So if you want me
Why are you tearing me apart
It's killing me slowly
Watching you hide behind your scars
Not here when I need you
I been trying to pull through
You play with my mind
Play with my mind
Play with my mind
But i'm just a fool for you
I play it cool for you
Every night, feeding me lies, I turn a blind eye too
I'm just a fool for you
I'm just a fool
For
You
I'm just a fool for you
I know you always tell me what I want to hear
It's like it's deafening the silence when you're near
All these blurred lines, but I still hold tight
Hoping you give me something that is real
So if you want me
Why are you tearing me apart
It's killing me slowly
Watching you hide behind your scars
Not here when I need you

 作曲 : Hayden Robert Hubers/Micah Premnath
I miss the days when life was so simple
Felt like the glass was always half full
Where did that go?

And every second with you was so special
Back when we didn't fear the unknowns
But that was long ago

Who can say where the path will go?
Philosophers guess but they just don't know
Maybe that's why

We had our heads in the clouds
Thought we had it all figured out
Planning to fly away
To escape everything on the ground
But like a plane up in space
We slowly drifted away
And every plan that we made
And dream that we chased
Are just memories now
They're just memories now

I'm not sure where everything went wrong
But I know that we landed where we both belong

I just wish we weren't scared to say
That there's expiration dates on the friends you make
As hard as that may sound

Who can say where the path will go?
Philosophers guess but they just don't know
Maybe that's why

We had our heads in the clouds
Thought we had it all figured out
Planning to fly away
To escape everything on the ground
But like a plane up in space
We slowly drifted away
And every plan that we made
And dream that we chased
Are just memories now
They're just memories now

Who can say where the path will go?

I've been far away, I'mma lumineer now, I make moves start waves
I've been dreaming about flying for a long time
I had a vision from the grey's they wanna co-sign
Artificially intelligent New-AI
I'm your future past and present, I'm the fine line
Yeah, I'm a missing link of this illusion
I am not really here, I'm an intrusion
I don't swim or sink, I just float
I don't need gravity, I just need growth, (wooh)
When I move it's an earthquake rumble
I will never ever fall, never stumble
And I don't need to be humble
Break down walls like Jericho crumble
I can go higher
Past the stratosphere, I can catch fire
I can go hard, I don't even need to try, yeah
Starblood, I don't ever get tired
Predestined written in stone
I feel it coming in, I feel it in my bones
Heavily protected never alone
Tapped in, I'm connected to the unknown, (wooh, woooh)

I will never ever fall, never stumble
And I don't need to be humble
Break down walls like Jericho crumble

And every time we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
and everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go
Want you in my life
Your arms are my castle
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad times
We've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (Ooh)

Seeing all the vultures circling
Burning in the flames I'm working in
Turning in a bed that's darkening

Turning the pages of my life
Walking the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leaving the ones that never cared
Picking the pieces up and building to the sky

I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up’s a waste of time
So I think I’ll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star, I’m soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I’ll be fine
‘Cus I know Peter Pan was right

Just a lost boy in a small town
I’m the same kid but I’m grown now
Try to make it out
But I don’t know how
Wish that I was young
What have I become

Now it’s late night and I’m at home
So I make friends with my shadow
And I play him all my sad, sad songs
And we don’t talk
But he sings along like

Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm

I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up’s a waste of time
So I think I’ll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star, I’m soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I’ll be fine
‘Cus I know Peter Pan was right

Days feel like a blur now
Still feel eighteen but I’m burnt out
So I daydream of what I could be
If I turned back time
To a storyline
Where my mom read me a tale where
A couple kids, one girl and a sailor
Met a boy in green
I thought it’d be me
But I guess that dream
Wasn’t meant to be like

Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm

I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up’s a waste of time
So I think I’ll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star, I’m soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I’ll be fine
‘Cus I know Peter Pan was right

And I don’t care
If I never land
Cus’ the distant sky’s
Always better than
My life right now
And the place I am
So for one last time
I guess Peter Pan

I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up’s a waste of time
So I think I’ll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star, I’m soaring

They say that life is always easier
After you let yourself come undone
They say they'll give you whatever you want
And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
Till I'm in the ground
Keep your past your own, I don't care about before
I don't wanna know your secrets, I wanna help you keep yours
No one needs to, no one'll ever know what we do
Where we go, why don't we go to a place where only we know?
Where we escape from real life and it feels good and it feels nice
That we ain't yet but we still might
Cause we go with it if it feels right
And it feels... feels amazing
We ain't ready to see the day And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
Till I'm in the ground
Let go of fear
This can be a secret that we both keep, that we both share
Keep it behind the smiles we both wear
As the sun creeps through the curtains
On the walls we become two silhouettes
As we close our eyes
Let go of the lies that fill our heads
Let's light it up, live life in the moment
Why would we worry about where we might end up?
They can't see us, they can't judge us, it's just us
They might wonder but only we know where we go when the sun comes up
And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
Till I'm in the ground
I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the sun
Where I belong there's something coming on
I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the sun
Oh, and I need you
Chasing it, chasing it
I don't know what I'm chasing is
All I know is I've been craving it
Ever since I had a taste of it
Life is what you make of it
We're just here writing our own books
This is just a page of it
Before you wave your fingers at us
You better make sure your hands are clean
We all obey, our hands are tied
And I don't wanna have to leave
I don't wanna say goodbye
They say life is always easier when you come undone
When I go, you'll know where I've gone
And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
Till I'm in the ground

 作曲 : Dani Brillhart/Colton Jones
Closed off from love
I didn’t need the pain
Once or twice was enough
But it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you’re frozen
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground
Found something true
And everyone’s looking round
Thinking I’m going crazy
But I don’t care what they say
I’m in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don’t know the truth
My heart’s crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
I Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
I Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
And it’s draining all of me
So they found it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see
I don’t care what they say
I’m in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don’t know the truth
My heart’s crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I....
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and  I

 Too many lonely days, too many solo nights
 I'll be back in your arms at midnight
 Hold me 'cause I'm scared to be lonely

 Strapped up, but I know how to fight
 Trauma kid, but future lookin' bright
 Money long, just stackin' different height
 Ain't gon' let 'em take me out tonight
 In the stu', I'm workin' 'cause I'm paid
 Tryna flex these millions I made
 Phone ringin', niggas wanna talk
 I ain't pick that shit up in some days

 Dead broke nigga, come from rags
 Sorry if me shinin' gets you mad
 Niggas got no motion, shit be sad
 So they say I'm cocky when I brag
 I was low, low, down bad
 Went to school, no money, 'bout to crash
 Turnin' this shit to somethin' was a task
 Now you look at me, you see the glass
 Foreign V's, hoppin' out the whip
 'Member me and Lola hoppin' cabs (Damn)
 Sittin', smokin', thinkin' 'bout my life (Sit)
 Why the good go so fast? (Damn)
 Why would God save my type? (Huh?)
 He know all my secrets from the past (Damn)
 Thinkin' 'bout the shit I been through (Damn)
 I ain't probably come out so bad (Oh)

 Strapped up, but I know how to fight

 Ain't gon' let 'em take me out tonight
 In the stu', I'm workin' 'cause I'm paid
 Tryna flex these millions I made
 Phone ringin', niggas wanna talk
 I ain't pick that shit up in some days

 So many times I could've died (Hey, died, died)
 I don't be prayin', no lie, but I won't deny
 Something saved me, something saved me
 God, oh, why?

 Grind mode, that be always (Hey)
 I'm just tryna give myself a raise
 Life hard, I be makin' plays (Huh?)
 Like I'm tryna figure out a maze
 From the heart whenever I write
 Trauma on my mental won't fade
 Shot seven times, no glaze (Shot)
 We done put some niggas in the—
 I could show a nigga how to act
 .40 cal', it teach him to behave
 I come from a city if you lack
 You must watch your shit up on the page
 Lotta shit can't say up in these raps (No)
 Know I'm different, I just got my ways
 Shit be on my mental, so I blaze (Boom)
 Free my niggas sittin' in the cage (Boom, boom)

 Strapped up, but I know how to fight

 Flamingo Pink, Sunrise Boulevard
 Clink, clink, being this young is art
 Aquamarine, moonlit swimming pool
 What if all I need is you?

 Got love-struck, went straight to my head
 Got lovesick all over my bed
 Love to think you'll never forget
 Handprints in wet cement
 Adorned with smoke on my clothes
 Lovelorn and nobody knows
 Love thorns all over this rose
 I'll pay the price, you won't

 But if I'm all dressed up
 They might as well be lookin' at us
 And if they call me a slut
 You know it might be worth it for once
 And if I'm gonna be drunk
 I might as well be drunk in love

 Send the code, he's waitin' there
 The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
 Everyone wants him, that was my crime
 The wrong place at the right time
 And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
 In a world of boys, he's a gentleman

 Got love-struck, went right to my head (Straight to my head)
 Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)
 Love to think you'll never forget
 We'll pay the price, I guess

 But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up)
 They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
 And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)
 You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
 And if I'm gonna be drunk
 I might as well be drunk in love

 Half asleep, takin' your time
 In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury
 You're not sayin' you're in love with me
 But you're going to
 Half awake, takin' your chances
 It's a big mistake, I said, ""It might blow up in your pretty face""
 I'm not saying, ""Do it anyway"" (Do it anyway)
 But you're going to

 (Up)
 And if they call me a (Slut)
 You know it might be worth it for once
 And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)
 I might as well be drunk in love

I might go insane
If I can't erase
My own thoughts

I think I'm in flames

Until the light in her eyes it was all but gone

So keep your head up princess 'fore your crown falls
Know these voices in your head will be your downfall

And the path leads right to where they won't go
I know it hurts right now but I know you'll make it home

And now she's grown up, works at a bar
She traded make shift gowns for serving round from sunrise 'til it's dark
And all her friends got, someone to hold
And she's got no one there, still not prepared to make it on her own

And now the light in her eyes it's now all but gone

I’ve been doing what they tell me

But it didn’t really help me
And I haven’t got the patience
Even took up yoga
And journaling my thoughts
You should see my diary
Cause it goes on for pages

But when the lights go down and i’m all alone
All the fears come out dressed as the unknown
It’s a messy maze I can’t navigate
It’s a heavy flood and someone broke the gates

I wish it was quiet
I overthink too much
Yeah I’m Rapunzel stuck inside my head
No peace in my mind
It goes on and on
Wish I could turn it off and it would shut up

I wish my mind would shut up

overthinking every night)

The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights

Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I would still be holding you like this

You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine

Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me the chances since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for

 作曲 : Annie Clark/Taylor Swift/Jack Antonoff
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't want to keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer

Hey, everybody
My mom 'n dad made this new song called ""My Stupid Heart""
I'm gonna play it with my brothers
Let's gooooooo!!

My stupid heart
Don't know
I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door
My stupid

Can't believe that I haven't figured out by now
Every time I call you up
All you do is let me down (Let's Go!)

Shoulda known there was nothing about us I could change
Everytime we try to be friends
It always ends the same

But when I try to remember
All the pain that we've been through
Something in me says whatever
And it brings me back to you

My stupid heart
Don't know
I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door
My stupid heart
Too late
Already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart
(Okay!)
(Okay!)
You can blame my stupid heart
(Okay!)
(Okay!)
You can blame my stupid heart

Every now and then I get inside my head
Try to leave your text unread
But I wind up here instead

I shoulda bit my tongue while we were still ahead
Yeah always had to be right
Til we had nothing left

But when I try to remember
All the pain that we've been through
Something in me says whatever
And it brings me back to you

My stupid heart
Don't know
I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door
My stupid heart
Too late
Already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart (Let's Go!)
(Okay!)
(Okay!)

You can blame my stupid heart
I've tried to let you go
So many times before
You can blame my stupid heart
Too late
Already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart
Too late
Already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart

Oh my (Oh my), she's a long way from suburban town
Long way (Long way), really long way from suburbia


Small town love, fall down love, not medicated
Drink too much, think too much, thoughts drowning me
Im too high, please don’t dry, stop downing me
You don't know love, you just show love, stop downing me


Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me

Big dreams, yeah (Yo), big screams, yeah (Oh, yo), she's impressionable
Hate to see, yeah (Wpah), money scheme, yeah (Woah), live and questionable
My friends drive new beamers, drop top convertibles
Love hangin' out, say you hate it now, feelin' introvertical


Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me

Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Some time the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me up, I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me up, I'm not dreaming

Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more ****ing love song i'll be sick
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home

Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' into new (Oh, oh)
Without you goin' smooth (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I won't just leave
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can’t sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' through
I was running away from facin' reality
Wastin' all of my time on living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby
I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you
It was definitely a blessing, wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
I said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still right for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughing but the joke’s not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holding all this love out here in the hall
I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
You’re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before
I can see you staring, honey
Like he’s just your understudy
Like you’d get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancing on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
I’m not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before
So I’m leaving out the side door
So step right out
There is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn’t even hear me out
(Didn’t even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign
(I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind
(Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn’t turn things around
(You never turned things around)
Cause you never gave a warning sign
(I gave so many signs)
(So many signs)
(So many signs)
You didn’t even see the signs
I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
You’re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before
So I’m leaving out the side door

It’s been a couple of years since I've seen your face
Wondering what you're up to now
Yeah my head is still up in space
I guess it never came down
I can tell you that I’ve changed a bit though
Not too much since then
We were always rebellious kids
Do you remember when
We were riding through the night
The moon was on our side
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
As high as the stars in the sky
Crossing all the lines
Once upon a time
Once upon a time

Do you recall all the promises
We used to make back then
Can you tell me are they still on
Or is that silly of me to think
The years I find separate us
I think of you now and then
Won’t let the memories fade to dust
Baby remember when
We were riding through the night
The moon was on our side
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
As high as the stars in the sky
Crossing all the lines
Once upon a time
Once upon a time

We were riding through the night
The moon was on our side
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
As high as the stars in the sky
Crossing all the lines
Once upon a time
Once upon a time

 I need to keep you around
 With my feet tied
 With my feet tied tight to the ground
 The end's nowhere to be found
 I don’t know why
 You don’t leave me to drown oh-oh-oh

 Don’t know where to go unless you say
 Don’t know what to do unless you stay
 Thinking that today will be our day
 Will be our day again

 Why am I playing with time as it’s ticking away?
Tickin’ away, away
I’m askin’ why we run for our lives
not a second to waste?
Tickin’ away, away, away
 Let's get it
 Winnin
 Losin
 Either way I'm there
 Gotta attitude
 I'm out the roof
 Up in the air
 This round I make it count
 Yeah I'm talkin right now
 Feel like the comeback kid
 I got no time to spare
 Woah
 Double up the score
 Turn a 2 to a 4
 You know I win a lot
 Gotta win one more
 On a hot streak
 Never gets old
 Solo with the ace
 And my team went gold
 Why am I playing with time as it’s ticking away?
 Tickin’ away, away, I’m askin’
 Why, we run for our lives
not a second to waste?
 Tickin’ away, away, away
 Tickin’ away, away, away
 Tickin’ away, away, away

 I’ll give it one more try
 I don’t know why
 But I keep comin’ back every time
 I want it more than my life
 I don’t know why
 But it feels so right

 Why am I playing with time as it’s ticking away?
 Tickin’ away, away
 I’m askin’ why, we run for our lives
not a second to waste?
 Tickin’ away, away, away
 Tickin’ away, away, away
 Tickin’ away, away, away…

Oh woah, woah, oh, oh,
Oh, woah, oh-oh,
Oh-oh, oh,
Like a moth to a flame,
I'll pull you in, I'll pull you back to,
What you need initially （Oh-oh, oh），
It's just one call away, ayy, ayy,
And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me,
But this time I'll let you be,
'Cause he seems like he's good for you,
And he makes you feel like you should,
And all your friends say, ""He's the one"",
His love for you is true, ooh-ooh,
But does he know you call me when he sleeps?
Or does he know the pictures that you keep?
Or does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies?
Yeah, you should be with him, I let you go from time （Uh, yeah），
You should stay with him,
'Cause he seems like he's good for you,
And he makes you feel like you should,
And all your friends say, ""He's the one"",
His love for you is true, ooh-ooh （Ooh），
But does he know you call me when he sleeps? （No-no, oh），
Or does he know the pictures that you keep? （Oh），
Or does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies?
Right here with me, baby,
Where it truly lies,
My baby,
Where it truly lies,
Give me all of it,
Where it truly lies,
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh,
Where it truly lies.
My darkest hours,
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room,
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you,
I turned into the man I used to be, to be,
Put myself to sleep,
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams,
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me,
I just wanted to call you and say, and say,
Oh, baby,
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close,
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart,
Never comin' through,
I was running away from facin' reality,
Wastin' all of my time on living my fantasies,
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate,
'Cause I want you, baby,
I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you,
It was definitely a blessing, wakin' beside you,
I'll never let you down again, again,
Oh, baby,
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close,
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart,
I said, baby,
I'll treat you better than I did before,
I'll hold you down and not let you go,
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah,
I know it's all my fault,
Made you put down your guard,
I know I made you fall,
I said you were wrong for me,
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you （To you），
Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you,
You did some things that you regret, still right for you,
'Cause this house is not a home,
Without my baby,
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close,
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart,
And I said, baby,
I'll treat you better than I did before,
I'll hold you down and not let you go,
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no.

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
Baby just say yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh oh
Cause you were Romeo I was  a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
Baby just say yes
Romeo save me
They’re trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story
Baby just say yes
Oh oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
Romeo save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It's a love story
Baby just say yes
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

 编曲 : Samuel Kim/Rosa Walton
I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards
But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign
Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
Because I miss you all the time

So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
Let yourself go
Is that a compromise

So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view
There's a party soon, do you wanna go
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know

And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter
'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies
And why do I so want to call you

So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view
There's a party soon, do you wanna go
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know

You
Oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I'm no-one
So, get away

Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go

Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
The summer nights, the bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

I'm Calling you now, but you're not picking up
Your shadow‘s so close if you are still in love
Then light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
So far away

It's breaking me, I'm losing you
We were far from perfect
But we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried
But never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me

You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's too close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now
But somehow it still breaks my heart
We could have had the stars, oh

Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love

Oh, boy
You know
I know
you’re making up the truth
Why can’t
I go
before I loose my cool
I love you even if it’s difficult
Don’t worry just because I need to leave
Don’t mean I’m sick of us, of you and me
I’m just not good at showing sympathy
Give me a break
I’m not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I’m not angry anymore
Just a little upset now
Cause I Wanna be better than I was before
But I can’t do it if we don’t mature
Not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I love the way you look me in the eyes
When you choke up but can’t apologize
Cause you are too afraid to hurt your pride
I guess you were just so misunderstood
You know I’m never truly gone for good
If I could look inside your brain you know I would, you know I would, you know
I’m not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I’m not angry anymore
Just a little upset now
Cause I Wanna be better than  I was before
But I can’t do it if we don’t mature

That it isn't you so baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you but you so sweet

I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately you've been acting like you hardly know me

How to be brave

But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you

And you don't seem to understand
A shame you seemed an honest man
And all the fears you hold so dear
Will turn to whisper in your ear
And you know what they say might hurt you
And you know that it means so much
And you don't even feel a thing
I am falling, I am fading,
I have lost it all

And you don't seem the lying kind
A shame then I can read your mind
And all the things that I read there
Candle lit smile that we both share
And you know I don't mean to hurt you
But you know that it means so much
And you don't even feel a thing
I am falling, I am fading,
I am drowning,
Help me to breathe
I am hurting,I have lost it all

I could say I never dare
To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But, I won't deny that
In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you
Boy, you got me hooked on to something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend the summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And I could say I never answered
Those believers inside my head
But that's far from the truth
Don't know what's come over me
It seems like yesterday when I said
“We'll be friends forever”
Constellations of stars
Murals on city walls
I don't see nobody but you
You're my vice, you're my muse
You're a nineteenth floor view
I don't see nobody but you

I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
I know I created myself
I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights
But I never asked for your help

You got hurt
No, we don't belong together
So you took the love from my arms
Into the arms of yours

But I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me

I don't like the tension, the misapprehensions
About our nature in love
The glorious teachers are no use for creatures
Who knows how to play with the gods

You got nerves, but they never show
Unless they hurt, so you blamed it all
On my love, the moving
Heart I got

But I don't need a cure for me

 You went to a party
 I heard from everybody
 You part the crowd like the Red Sea
 Don't even get me started
 Did you get anxious though
 On the way home?
 I guess I'll never, ever know
 Now that we don't talk
 You grew your hair long
 You got new icons
 And from the outside
 It looks like you're tryin' lives on
 I miss the old ways
 You didn't have to change
 But I guess I don't have a say
 Now that we don't talk
 I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
 Remind myself, the more I gave, you'd want me less
 I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
 And what it cost, now that we don't talk
 What do you tell your friends we
 Shared dinners, long weekends with?
 Truth is, I can't pretend it's
 Platonic, it's just ended, so
 I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
 Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left)
 I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
 And what it cost, now that we don't talk
 I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
 Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
 With important men who think important thoughts
 Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
 And the only way back to my dignity
 Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
 Just like I had seen when you were chasing me
 Guess this is how it was to be now that we don't talk

Ooh Ahh ahh ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't go
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Only time I feel pain, when I feel in love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time you come my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really  alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feeling really lost, ducking all the attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind

独自收集两个人之间的回忆
即使每当到这时候我都会哭泣
为何一切
变得如此
无法回到过去
我们都是渺小真实存在
祈愿小世界里不只有挫败
直到遇见你我以为就光明起来
眼睛里看到的都是广袤无垠的大海
有你在的日子里不可能被取代
在最灰暗的日子你陪着我发呆
你让我学会如何拨开阴霾
将快乐全都收集将不开心全都淘汰
你对我说的情话
像转瞬即逝的烟花
只停在绽放一刹那
我却已无法自拔
我们的爱总有时差
也为你骗自己放下
爱炙热的你 却忘了爱自己
和你在一起画面一帧帧唤醒脑海
你总说我是小孩对我总是想溺爱
我像做了一场梦梦见我们的未来
我们俩嬉嬉闹闹直到梦突然醒来
想和你说声谢谢至少笑着离开
不想闹的不愉快 互相不理不睬
我想说爱这件事总要履行告白
最后就用朋友身份说拜拜
有你在的日子里不可能被取代
在最灰暗的日子你陪着我发呆
你让我学会如何拨开阴霾
将快乐全都收集将不开心全都淘汰
你对我说的情话
像转瞬即逝的烟花
只停在绽放一刹那
我却已无法自拔
我们的爱总有时差
也为你骗自己放下
爱炙热的你 却忘了爱自己
独自收集两个人之间的回忆
即使每当到这时候我都会哭泣
为何一切
变得如此
无法回到过去
但我仍愿意感谢你给过我爱情
每一场风景都是我们爱的证明
就算如今天各一方
祝你余生动听啊
你对我说的情话
像转瞬即逝的烟花
只停在绽放一刹那
我早已无法自拔
我们的爱总有时差
也为你骗自己放下
爱炙热的你 却忘了爱自己

 Leave me like you do

 Don't leave me alone

 Oh, father, forgive me

 Come break down these walls
 Don't leave me alone

 Too cold, it's withdrawal
 This house ain't a home
 Wrapped around your finger
 Wish your tongue would linger
 I need your warmth
 Just to stay high
 Now, you're holding me down
 I scream but make no sound
 Nothing to hold
 My hands are tied
 Call me Babydoll
 Come break down these walls
 Don't leave me alone
 Call me Babydoll
 Too cold, it's withdrawal

 I walk around the mall but theres nobody with me

I missed your 21st birthday, I’ve been up at home
Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
Hate to picture you half drunk, happy
Hate to think you went out without me
I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you I would
Thought you'd see it comin' but you never could
I still haven't heard from your family
But you said your mom always loved me
Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever
I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under
Audrey said she saw you out past twelve o'clock
Just because you're hurting doesn't mean I'm not
If it doesn't go away by the time I turn 30
I made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm, sorry (Sorry)
Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever
I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
Yeah I I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If ""Happy Ever After"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of ****
One more ******* love song I'll be sick
Oh you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

Where are the plans we made for two

I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of ****
One more ******* love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Man **** that ****
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt
You can tell it I'm ballin
Swish what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want so you can go and take
That little piece of **** with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If ""Happy Ever After"" did exist

There’s no easy way to explain
make it all go away
I am to blame

I never, I never...
I never loved you if we're honest，honest
I know this isn’t what we promised，promised

But you’re so far, far

You’re not like me
You’re too good
Still you want me
I knew you would

I thought it was love ‘cause
It hooked like a drug
But that’s not enough
I’m calling my bluff

So much time like who knew

You're living in Wonderland
If you think I'll understand
All the shit you put me through
If girls in white dresses
And big winter weddings
Is something you want to be true
Then pack up your drama
This selfish dilemma
Is something this shit can't undo
Like I would never hate you
But only if you want to
So much time like who knew

Because I miss you all the time

'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know

And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter
'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies
And why do I so want to call you

292,25657526,Catch My Breath,https://music.163.com/song?id=25657526," 作词 : Kelly Clarkson/Eric Olson/Jason Halbert
 作曲 : Eric Olson/Jason Halbert
I don't wanna be left behind

Distance was a friend of mine

Catching breath in a web of lies

I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat

Shadowboxing the other half

Learning how to react

I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath,
letting it go,
turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know,
this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath,
no one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that

Catch my breath,
won't let them get me down,
it's all so simple now
Addicted to the love I found

Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud

Making time for the ones that count

I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down

Leaving footprints all over town

Keeping faith, karma comes around

I will spent the rest of my life

Catching my breath,
letting it go,
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know,
this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath,
no one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that

Catch my breath,
won't let them get me down,
it's all so simple now

You helped me see

The beauty in everything

Catching my breath,
letting it go,
turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know,
this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catching my breath,
letting it go,
turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know,
this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
Catch my breath,
no one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that

Catch my breath,
won't let them get me down,
it's all so simple now
It's all so simple now
Catching my breath,
letting it go,
turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know,
this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath,
no one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,

won't let them get me down,
it's all so simple now

 作曲 : Patrick Hizon/Emily Jean
 I still have your faded Nike sweatshirt
 So when you coming back home
 To the city, streetlights, mayhem
 I know you're missing that, oh

 I've almost had enough
 Of just your face on my phone
 It's old news but I miss you

 Counting down the days
 Every minute every hour
 Got me going insane
 While the leaves fall off your flowers

 I'm wishing you were closer
 Your coffee's getting colder
 Can't you see I'm waking up
 Without the piece of me I love

 Wondering if it's all worth it
 But I know in my heart it's right
 Cause I

 I still have your faded Nike sweatshirt
 So when you coming back home
 To the city, streetlights, mayhem
 I know you're missing that, oh

 I've almost had enough
 Of just your face on my phone
 It's old news but I miss you

 You always make it easy
 every time that we're together
 But I never realized how the list
 goes on and on forever

 The way you lean in for a kiss
 And how we sang along to Taylor swift
 You're kindly conscious of all my nonsense
 Oh it's the little things I miss

 Wondering if it's all worth it
 But I know in my heart it's right
 Cause I

 I still have your faded Nike sweatshirt
 So when you coming back home
 To the city, streetlights, mayhem
 I know you're missing that, oh
 I've almost had enough
 Of just your face on my phone

 It's old news but I miss you
 It's old news but I miss you

I wish we didn't have so many friends in common
I wish we didn't have to walk around our problems
I wish we didn't have to take all these precautions
So many bad things that I miss
That I miss that I miss you
I wish we could come together take over the summer
Wanna be a couple where we introduce our mothers
I been walking round the world about a mile a minute
I know I'm not perfect man but I must admit it
Through all of the hard times
Had to keep a strong mind for you
Wanna make you all mine
Talk about the good times with you
I wish that we could learn just how to love each other
Don't wanna go somewhere you can't find another
Just be my love be my love
Just be my love be my love
I know it ain't easy trying to love another man
Got so many flaws but baby I understsnd
Better if we work on this together
Flying through any end all endeavors
Through all of the hard times
Had to keep a strong mind for you
Wanna make you all mine
Talk about the good times with you
I wish that we could learn just how to love each other
Don't wanna go somewhere
You can't find another
Just be my love be my love
Just be my love be my love
So I don't run into you
So I don't run right into you
So I don't run right into you
Even throngh that's what I wanna do

 作曲 : eternal raijin
Don't you think about me enough
I've been burning my heart out
(I've) got to face, need to tell you
I won't run because I'm reticent
Raijin...
You will know you're reborn tonight
Must be ragged, but I stay by your side
Even if my body's bleached to the bones
I don't want (to) go through that ever again
So cry no more
Oh my beloved
Go ahead, be proud and fight it out
You are the one
Our rising star
You guide us far to home(yet girt)
You are the one
Our rising star

 作曲 : Connor Price
Yeah
Straight A student but I'm friends with the cool kids
Following the rules in the rubric
Freestyle on the bus and it's too lit
Everybody like oh damn who's this
Raising the steaks like Ruth's Chris
Clockwork how I shine like Kubrick
Yeah I heard what you got with the music
Think that it's hot but it's not like mucus
Pick a side never switch get a back bone
Girl the only one that hit me on the bat phone
Turn a rap flow to a cash flow
Cash cow got the game in a lasso
Five figures this week, no show yet
Yeah I do it all form a home set up
Turn a TikTok to a Rolex
And it got more views than a Coachella
Make money off streams cause I own it
Can't exploit me cause I know better
Work smarter not harder I know this
But I still do both I'm a go-getter
Scroll back on the Gram you can see just how I did it, ay
This ain't overnight I been at it for a minute, ay
World gave me lemons and I turned it into lemonade
Got the juice and I made a brand off of it like I'm Minute Maid
Straight A student but I'm friends with the cool kids
Following the rules in the rubric
Freestyle on the bus and it's too lit
Everybody like oh damn who's this
Ship don't sink no loose lips
What a row boat to a cruise ship
What a penny stock to a blue chip
What's an NPC to a blue tick
Whole life felt protagonist
Like Bilbo Baggans is
Name got weight no dragging this
Too big for the scale like dragon skin
Now I'm just headed to the top go kill it
Said he gonna pop no kidding
I can never stop no chilling
Way too attached yeah I caught those feeling
Shot through the roof I ain't got no ceiling
Boom
Hit em' with the hook, reel em in like it's a fishing line
Hit the ground running and I'm blowing through the finish line
Everybody in the crowd bounce when I finish lines
Make em'a all dance like the Finnish prime minister
Face so innocent, flow so sinister
Pay those dividends, hold no prisoners
Try to put it all in a verse
Phone DND so please no visitors
Yeah
Straight A student but I'm friends with the cool kids
Following the rules in the rubric
Freestyle on the bus and it's too lit
Everybody like oh damn who's this
Raising the steaks like Ruth's Chris
Clockwork how I shine like Kubrick
Yeah I heard what you got with the music
Think that it's hot but it's not like mucus

 作曲 : Peter Dyer/Harlan Silverman/Jen Hirsh
Been a while since I've seen you around
Funny catching you here on my ground
You look good, I can tell you've been sleeping
Isn't this the kind of party you hate?
I can tell what you're thinking
And you'll always be making the worst of it all
Did you think by now I'd be crashing
And burning straight through the wall?

Same as I ever was
I'd do it all because
Life's too short to not live Wild
Same as I ever was
High on a couple d**ks
Life's too short to not live Wild
Live Wild
Live Wild

I don't care about the consequence
I don't need it all to make any sense
You always hesitate to have a good time
I hope you're happy in your house of glass
I can tell what you're thinking
And you'll always be making the worst of it all
Did you think by now I'd be crashing
And burning straight through the wall?

Same as I ever was
I'd do it all because
Life's too short to not live Wild
Same as I ever was
High on a couple d**ks
Life's too short to not live Wild
Live Wild
Live Wild
Live Wild
Live Wild
Live Wild

Same as I ever was
I'd do it all because
Life's too short to not live Wild
Same as I ever was
High on a couple d**ks
Life's too short to not live Wild
